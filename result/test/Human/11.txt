Some people argue that artistical subjects should be teached to all the scholars in secondary school. As I greatly believe in the importance of these areas of knowledge, I would say that I emphatically agree with this idea. My firm belief is based on the fact that studying art and music in the secondary school can develops in the learner high levels of creativity, opening is mind for whatever future they will choose, in addition, learning more about these subjects the students could find their own life path becaming musician or artists.

First and foremost, we should ask ourself, what is the most importan skill that studying art and music a scholar could adquire? Undoubtedly creativity is the answer. As is well known, it is fundamental in all types of jobs, that because it allows you to solve the problems you will meet in your carreer in a out of ordinary way. This different and innovative way to overcome difficulties is due to the open-mindedness that an creative thinking gives to you. Using my personal experience as an example, studying photography during all the second and high school has been helping me in my current job in a company, giving me greatly mental tools useful to solve the daily problems I have to face with.

Furthermore we have not to forgive that second school have the aim to help the learner to find their own life path. Teaching a wide range of subjects, including the artistic ones, some students could find in art or music their passion and became the next Dali or Beethoven. As art and music require a huge amount of experience, starting from younger age, when, moreover, the brain has is maximum flexibility, can gives to the students strong bases to excel in the future. It is well known that the majority of the artists has been training all the life, starting from the early age.

Taking everything in consideration, I believe that governments should decide to teach art and music in second schools to give to the students not only a fundamental tool useful in their future lives, but also the possibility to finf out their real passions.
