"Traffic congestion is a pressing issue in urban areas, causing stress and wasted time for commuters. However, there are alternative forms of transport that have the potential to alleviate this congestion and improve overall transportation efficiency. In this essay, we will examine some of these alternative forms of transport and explain how they can help to reduce traffic jams in cities.

One alternative form of transport that has gained popularity in recent years is cycling. Cycling is a sustainable and affordable way to travel short distances, and it can help to reduce congestion by taking cars off the road. Many cities have implemented cycling infrastructure, such as dedicated bike lanes, to encourage more people to take up cycling. In addition, bike sharing schemes, where people can rent bikes for short periods of time, are becoming increasingly popular.

Another alternative form of transport that can help to alleviate traffic congestion is walking. Walking is a free and convenient way to travel short distances. It also has the added benefit of promoting physical activity, which can have positive effects on health. Many cities have implemented pedestrian zones, where cars are not allowed, to encourage more people to walk.

Public transportation is also a great way to alleviate traffic congestion. Buses and trains can transport large numbers of people at once, reducing the number of cars on the road. Many cities have invested in public transportation infrastructure, such as dedicated bus lanes and subway systems, to make it more accessible and efficient.

Electric and hybrid vehicles are another alternative form of transport that can help to alleviate traffic congestion. These vehicles produce fewer emissions than traditional cars, making them a more environmentally friendly option. In addition, many governments offer financial incentives for people who buy electric or hybrid vehicles, which can help to encourage more people to make the switch.

In conclusion, there are many alternative forms of transport that can help to alleviate traffic congestion in urban areas. These include cycling, walking, public transportation, and electric and hybrid vehicles. By promoting these alternative forms of transport, cities can reduce congestion, improve transportation efficiency, and help to create healthier and more sustainable communities.",Alternative forms of transport to alleviate traffic congestion,6.0,360.0,20.0,18.0,26.0,11.0,7.85,181.0,0.3027777777777777,0.1805555555555555,0.1472222222222222,0.025,0.0305555555555555,8.0,0.0394088669950738,5.6,0.4123456790123457,354.0,146.88213628888312,0.0,0.0,146.88213628888312,11.5,13.9,14.09,3.9902591874730216,0.212,0.014,0.774,39.0,0.0,0.3876543209876543,31,12,3,1.0
"There has been an ongoing debate on whether giving aid to poorer countries has more negative effects than positive. While some argue that aid can provide essential support for impoverished communities and help promote development, others contend that aid can create dependency, corruption, and undermine self-reliance. This essay will argue that giving aid to poorer countries has more negative effects than positive effects.

One of the primary negative effects of aid is the creation of dependency. When poorer countries rely on aid from wealthier nations, they may not develop the skills or infrastructure needed to support their own economies. Instead, they become reliant on aid and may become stuck in a cycle of dependence, which can lead to a lack of motivation for development and self-reliance. By creating this cycle of aid dependency, poorer countries get used to receiving handouts, and there is a reluctance to take control of their own resources. 

Furthermore, aid can encourage corruption within governments and create inequality within societies. In many poorer countries, aid is often administered by corrupt government officials. This corruption can lead to funds being misused or siphoned off, and little of the aid reaches the people it is intended to help. Additionally, aid can create a disparity between the wealthy and the poor, with aid money often going to those in power or better-connected individuals, rather than those who need it most, leading to an increase in inequality.

Another issue that arises with aid is that it can distort the market. When foreign aid floods into a particular sector within an economy, it can destabilize the market, undermining local entrepreneurs and industries. This can lead to a lack of competition and the closure of local businesses. Moreover, when aid is given to specific industries, the overall economy can be neglected, leading to unequal economic growth that further undermines a country's self-sufficiency.

Finally, aid can create a sense of entitlement and lead to a lack of accountability. When poor countries are used to receiving handouts from wealthier nations, it can lead to a false sense of entitlement. This could potentially lead to the neglect of responsibilities and accountability in the government, as they become complacent about their duties to the people they are supposed to serve.

In conclusion, while giving aid to poorer countries can seem like a noble effort to help alleviate poverty, in reality, it can have more negative effects than positive effects. Aid can create dependence, encourage corruption and inequality, distort markets, and foster a sense of entitlement. Rather than relying on aid, it would be better to focus on empowering poorer countries through sustainable investment and the development of their human capital.",Giving aid to poorer countries has more negative effects than positive effect,6.0,444.0,21.0,21.142857142857142,37.0,12.0,10.571428571428571,222.0,0.2792792792792792,0.1891891891891892,0.1081081081081081,0.0315315315315315,0.045045045045045,19.0,0.0837004405286343,6.333,0.4173387096774194,442.0,175.95744611992117,1.0,-0.0086609023569834,175.9487852175642,12.7,14.4,13.05,4.111594187417757,0.157,0.151,0.691,56.0,0.0,0.4475806451612903,23,10,3,1.0
"Globalization refers to the process of integrating different economies, cultures, and societies of the world. In recent times, globalization has had a significant impact on the world, leading to a decrease in global tension. In this essay, we will examine how globalization has contributed to a decrease in global tension.

One major effect of globalization has been the integration of economies. With the rapid development of technology, international trade and investment have become much easier than before. By opening up their economies to trade and investment, countries have been able to diversify their sources of income and increase their economic growth, leading to a decrease in global tension. Globalization has improved the standard of living for many people around the world, which has led to a greater sense of well-being, stability, and lowered tensions between different nations.

Another significant effect of globalization is the increased cultural exchange. People from different cultures and backgrounds have been able to interact more easily with each other, leading to a greater appreciation and understanding of other cultures. This has helped to reduce tension between people from different nations and cultures as people have become more accepting of different beliefs, lifestyles, and values. This understanding has led to a decrease in stereotyping and prejudice between nations, which has contributed to an increase in world peace.

The impact of globalization on technology has been another significant driver of the decrease in global tension. Globalization has led to a substantial growth in technology and the spread of information across continents, leading to greater accessibility of knowledge and information. This access has raised the level of awareness of global issues and challenges. With information at their fingertips, people are able to think globally and are more likely to understand other nations' perspectives, thereby reducing conflicts.

Furthermore, globalization has led to an increase in international organizations, which has improved global governance and cooperation. This cooperation has led to the development of policies that have lowered tensions between different nations. For example, international organizations such as the United Nations have played a crucial role in preventing conflicts, resolving conflicts peacefully and promoting adequate global governance. This cooperation has created a platform for diplomatic talks, preventing disputes from escalating into conflicts between nations.

In conclusion, globalization has had significant effects on the world, one of which is decreasing global tension. Globalization has integrated economies, increased cultural exchange, advanced technology, and improved global cooperation through international organizations. All these factors have contributed to a decrease in global tension, making the world a more peaceful place. While there are negative aspects of globalization â€“ the positive impact on global peace is significant. Therefore, it is essential to continue striving for a more connected world that values international cooperation and stability.",effects of globalization (decrease in global tension),6.0,457.0,24.0,19.041666666666668,31.0,10.0,9.0,215.0,0.299781181619256,0.1137855579868709,0.12472647702407,0.0065645514223194,0.0021881838074398,11.0,0.0456431535269709,6.583,0.373046875,451.0,175.5896155525295,0.0,0.0,175.5896155525295,13.1,16.0,16.48,3.903269463013874,0.182,0.088,0.73,52.0,0.0,0.421875,18,7,4,1.0
"The decision to study at school or get a job is a predicament that many young people face. This is one of the most critical decisions in an individual's life as it helps shape their future. In this essay, we will explore both choices, and analyze the benefits and drawbacks of each option.

Getting a job is an option that appeals to many individuals. It presents an immediate source of income, and those who get jobs can become financially stable early on in their lives. By getting a job, individuals can learn valuable life skills such as time management, responsibility, and character building. They can also gain practical experience, which can enhance their career prospects in the future. Additionally, getting a job can help an individual decide if they are interested in a particular field before committing to a full-time academic program that can be time-consuming, expensive, and may not lead to employment in said field.

On the other hand, studying at school is a better option for those who have a desire to acquire more knowledge and earn higher-paying jobs in the future. Education has been regarded as an essential foundation for success. By studying at school, individuals gain a comprehensive education that includes theoretical concepts, practical applications, research opportunities, and critical thinking skills that are valuable assets in the job market. In most cases, individuals who seek further education attain positions in their chosen fields and often earn higher salaries than those with only entry-level jobs.

Despite the aforementioned advantages of both options, neither one is disadvantage-free. Those who choose to get a job may not have adequate time to further their education and earn higher qualifications, which could hinder their career growth, opportunities, and earning potential in the long run. They may also lack job satisfaction, which may potentially lead to reduced productivity and stress. Meanwhile, those who choose to study at school must dedicate significant time and resources to their education, which may delay their entrance into the workforce, and lead to significant student loan burdens that can take many years to pay off.

In conclusion, whether to study at school or get a job is a highly subjective and personal decision that ultimately depends on an individual's situation, aspirations, and goals. While getting a job offers immediate financial stability and practical experience, studying at school, provides theoretical knowledge, and advanced career prospects. By critically examining both options, individuals can make informed decisions that align with their future career goals, personal aspirations and life plan.",Study at school or get a job?,5.0,419.0,19.0,22.05263157894737,40.0,10.0,10.894736842105264,227.0,0.2911694510739857,0.1742243436754176,0.1121718377088305,0.026252983293556,0.0381861575178997,9.0,0.0410958904109589,6.737,0.4597457627118644,421.0,177.82669370542763,0.0,0.0,177.82669370542763,13.1,15.1,13.29,4.182534565714813,0.141,0.045,0.815,60.0,0.0,0.4385593220338983,12,6,2,1.0
"In today's consumer-driven society, advertising is an essential aspect of the business world. Advertising is the process of promoting a product or service to potential customers. Despite its usefulness, several critics often argue that high sales reflect the power of advertising and not the real need. In this essay, I will explain why high sales reflect the power of advertising more than they reflect the real need.

Advertising agencies spend billions of dollars every year promoting their products and services to consumers. Ads are designed to appeal to specific emotions, such as happiness, joy, love, and fear, to create a desire for the product and spur consumers to purchase. These advertising techniques often bypass the consumer's rational thinking and trigger emotional responses, leading them to purchase things they may not need or want.

For example, Coca-Cola, a popular beverage company, spends over $4 billion annually on advertising. The company's ads are appealing, fun, and designed to evoke an emotional connection with the consumer. While Coca-Cola's products are high quality, consumers often buy Coca-Cola products because of the emotional connection they feel with the brand and its advertisements, rather than a real need for the product.

Furthermore, advertising creates a sense of identity associated with certain brands. By purchasing a particular brand, consumers feel as though they are buying into a particular lifestyle or image. Therefore, sales can be a result of consumers buying into the brand message and what the brand represents, rather than out of a genuine need for the product.

In contrast, real need is a situation where individuals require a specific product or service to fulfil their basic needs. Basic needs such as food and water, shelter, and healthcare are necessities that individuals need to survive. While advertising can make people more aware of certain products, it does not create a genuine need for those products.

Moreover, consumers' purchasing behaviour also changes as a result of advertising. Consumers who are constantly exposed to advertising will assume that they need a particular product, even if they do not, purely because they have seen it advertised repeatedly every day.

In conclusion, high sales reflect the power of advertising more than they reflect the real need. While advertising can be essential in promoting products and services, it often triggers emotional responses and creates a sense of identity associated with certain brands, leading consumers to buy into the brand message rather than actual needs. By being aware of these advertising strategies, consumers can make more informed decisions and choose products and services that fulfil their actual needs.",High sales reflect Power of Advertising and not the Real Need,7.0,426.0,21.0,20.285714285714285,37.0,11.0,9.523809523809524,208.0,0.3051643192488263,0.1478873239436619,0.096244131455399,0.0352112676056338,0.0164319248826291,12.0,0.051063829787234,5.429,0.4008264462809917,428.0,177.8827796316567,0.0,0.0,177.8827796316567,12.4,14.3,13.46,3.768674881073445,0.11,0.027,0.863,54.0,0.0,0.4132231404958678,33,15,3,1.0
"The issue of gun control has been a divisive topic for several years, particularly in the United States. Gun control refers to laws or policies that regulate or restrict the availability, sale, and use of firearms. While some believe that gun control measures are necessary to reduce the number of gun-related deaths, others argue that these regulations infringe on their right to bear arms. In this essay, we will examine the arguments presented by both sides of the gun control debate.

One of the main arguments for gun control is that it can help to reduce gun-related deaths. The presence of guns in the hands of individuals who are not mentally stable or who have criminal records can lead to fatal consequences for others. Gun control laws aim to limit the availability of firearms, hence reducing the number of gun-related deaths and injuries.

Additionally, gun control laws can help to curb mass shootings. These horrific events have become more common in recent years, which has led to widespread concern and calls for tougher gun control measures. Critics of gun control argue that these incidents are caused by mental health issues or a lack of security measures. However, proponents of gun control laws argue that preventing dangerous individuals from obtaining firearms is the most effective way to prevent mass shootings from occurring.

On the other hand, those against gun control argue that the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution grants them the right to bear arms. They contend that firearm ownership is a fundamental right that should not be restricted by government legislation. Additionally, those against gun control argue that responsible gun ownership should be encouraged instead of stigmatizing firearms or gun owners.

Critics also point out that gun control laws may not effectively prevent gun-related violence. Criminals may still acquire weapons illegally despite regulations, while law-abiding citizens who own guns may be at increased risk if they are disarmed due to new regulations. There is also an argument that gun control laws could lead to a black market for firearms, making it easier for criminals to obtain guns without going through the proper channels.

In conclusion, the issue of gun control is complex, and there are valid arguments presented by both sides. While some argue that gun control laws can help to reduce gun-related deaths and curb mass shootings, others argue that these laws would infringe on their constitutional right to bear arms. Ultimately, it is crucial to balance individual rights with public safety when it comes to firearm ownership. Regardless of one's opinion, everyone agrees that the issue of gun control must be addressed to reduce violence and promote safety.",Gun control,6.0,442.0,21.0,21.047619047619047,31.0,10.0,9.476190476190476,229.0,0.334841628959276,0.1764705882352941,0.0633484162895927,0.0316742081447963,0.0294117647058823,22.0,0.088,6.381,0.4481327800829875,442.0,175.5982782439714,1.0,-0.0710089108115084,175.52726933315992,11.5,13.7,12.42,4.154924118583514,0.1,0.225,0.674,49.0,0.0,0.412863070539419,23,11,3,1.0
"International sporting events such as the Olympic Games, the Commonwealth Games, and the FIFA World Cup are global events that bring together people from all over the world to celebrate athleticism, culture, and unity. International sporting events are significant opportunities to build bridges across communities and encourage diplomatic dialogue. In this essay, we will examine why international sporting occasions help to ease international tensions.

Firstly, international sporting events contribute to the improvement of international relations. Sporting events like the Olympics have the power to bring nations together due to the shared love of sport, and the opportunity to showcase talent and patriotism through healthy competition. These games encourage people of different cultures to work together, compete against each other in good sportsmanship, and share a common goal; to represent their country to the best of their ability, leading to improved interactions and perceptions between different countries. 

Moreover, international sporting events provide an opportunity for people to learn about other cultures and experiences. When countries host international sporting events such as the World Cup or Olympics, they often provide numerous cultural exchange programs that promote each country's culture, food, traditions, and arts. Participants and fans attending the events get to learn new things about other cultures and can interact and engage with people from different parts of the world, leading to increased mutual understanding and respect between nations.

In addition to fostering international relationships, international sporting events can also be used as a vehicle to draw attention to pressing political issues and conflicts. In many cases, athletes use their platform for activism and to raise awareness about humanitarian issues. This has the effect of drawing the world's attention to conflicts and inequalities, leading to the breaking down of barriers and increased dialogue on how to resolve the conflicts.

Lastly, international sporting events can create positive economic and social impacts on host nations. These events can stimulate investment in host cities and countries, leading to the creation of jobs, infrastructural development, heritage conservation, and an increase in tourism. This encourages positive international relations, with countries working together to develop and enhance the event, leaving a sense of pride and satisfaction for those who contribute.

In conclusion, international sporting events have the potential to foster international goodwill, promote cultural exchange, address important political issues, and provide tangible economic benefits. Events like the Olympic Games, FIFA World Cup, and the Commonwealth Games are instances where people from all over the world can come together, appreciate their different abilities, and connect at a human level regardless of their nationality or background. Therefore, it is important for the international community to continue promoting international sporting events to create a world that is unified and at the forefront of progress.",International sporting occasions help to ease international tensions,6.0,453.0,18.0,25.166666666666668,41.0,11.0,10.666666666666666,241.0,0.3024282560706401,0.1434878587196468,0.1147902869757174,0.0088300220750551,0.0132450331125827,14.0,0.053231939163498,6.722,0.4479371316306483,449.0,173.13271708819093,0.0,0.0,173.13271708819093,15.5,19.2,16.83,4.283945986799513,0.231,0.02,0.75,59.0,0.0,0.3772102161100196,8,4,2,1.0
"Technology has revolutionized almost every aspect of our lives and impacted both rich and poor. While some people benefit greatly from technological advancements, others remain disadvantaged and left behind. In this essay, we will examine how technology has widened the gap between the rich and poor.

One way in which technology has led to a widening gap between the rich and the poor is by increasing income inequality. Technological advancements often result in automation of jobs, which benefits the wealthy who have access to capital and can invest in technology, while the poor who rely on manual labor risk having their jobs replaced by machines. The rich have access to advanced education and training, enabling them to use technology to their advantage, thereby increasing their earning potential while leaving the poor at a disadvantage.

Furthermore, access to technology itself is a significant contributing factor to the wealth gap. For instance, access to high-speed internet is essential for the success of modern businesses, and those who lack access are at a significant disadvantage. Communities that lack access to technology, such as computers and the internet, are unable to take part fully in the global economy and cannot compete with others in the same economic conditions, leaving them behind in the race to progress.

In addition, technology has given rise to a new wave of entrepreneurs, who are primarily the rich. These entrepreneurs are usually those who have the capital and access to technological infrastructure we have discussed. They use their access to marketing platforms and social media to reach a broader audience. This results in big business that can quickly dominate markets, squeezing out smaller, locally-owned enterprises, leading to the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few.

Moreover, technological advancements often come at a steep price, limiting access to those who can afford it. Access to healthcare technology, for example, has saved countless lives. However, the cost of that access is prohibitive for the poor, who face increased difficulty in accessing these life-saving essentials. Expensive technologies such as AI, robotics, and high-tech medical procedures are beyond the reach of the poor, ultimately widening the wealth gap.

Lastly, the current pace of technological development is incredibly fast, making it hard for the underprivileged to keep up. Computers and mobile devices quickly outdated, requiring constant upgrading and investment. The cost of maintenance and repair limits access to technology for the poor, thereby denying them the full benefits of technological advancements available to the rich.

In conclusion, technology has indeed widened the gap between the rich and poor by increasing automation, creating uneven opportunities, increasing income inequality, accentuating the digital divide, accentuating global",technology that widen the gap between rich and poor?,7.0,441.0,21.0,21.0,40.0,10.0,10.047619047619047,239.0,0.2675736961451247,0.1360544217687075,0.1360544217687075,0.0362811791383219,0.0113378684807256,11.0,0.0468085106382978,6.238,0.4567404426559356,439.0,173.8403768622855,0.0,0.0,173.8403768622855,13.8,15.3,14.27,4.346260194968286,0.14,0.099,0.761,56.0,0.0,0.4245472837022133,9,4,3,1.0

"As students, it is important to focus on academics and strive towards achieving academic excellence. However, doing extra jobs outside of school can have numerous benefits, both in the short term and long term. Here are some of the benefits of students doing extra jobs:

Firstly, doing extra jobs can help students develop important life skills. By working outside of school, students can learn how to manage their time effectively, work independently and as part of a team, as well as develop interpersonal skills that are essential in any work environment. These skills are not only useful in the workplace but also in their personal lives, as they learn how to manage their finances and build a strong work ethic.

Secondly, doing extra jobs can help students gain practical experience in their areas of interest. For example, a student interested in marketing can seek internships or part-time jobs in businesses where they can gain hands-on experience in marketing. This provides a valuable opportunity for students to learn and apply their skills to real-world situations, leading to a more in-depth understanding of their chosen field.

Thirdly, doing extra jobs can help students become more financially independent. While finances may not be a primary concern for some students, others may need to support themselves or contribute to their family's finances. By doing extra jobs, students can learn the value of money and become more financially independent, allowing them to manage their finances more effectively and potentially reduce financial stress.

Lastly, doing extra jobs can help students develop a broader perspective towards life. By engaging in part-time jobs or internships in fields beyond their academic interests, students can learn about a diversity of fields and gain exposure to different career paths. This can broaden their perspective and help them make better-informed career choices.

In conclusion, while academics are important, doing extra jobs outside of school can provide numerous benefits to students. From gaining important life skills to gaining practical experience in their areas of interest, to becoming more financially independent and developing a broader perspective, students can benefit from engaging in part-time jobs or internships. Ultimately, the added experience, skills, and exposure gained through extra jobs can greatly contribute to students' success both in and outside of school.",Benefits of students doing extra jobs,6.0,375.0,17.0,22.058823529411764,35.0,11.0,10.352941176470589,184.0,0.288,0.2,0.104,0.016,0.0426666666666666,14.0,0.0676328502415458,6.118,0.3985680190930787,377.0,153.55071546475537,0.0,0.0,153.55071546475537,13.1,15.5,13.87,3.7672522905258687,0.253,0.012,0.735,58.0,0.0,0.4200477326968974,30,13,4,1.0

"Paying employees more money is often viewed as the best way to motivate employees and improve their job performance. However, while money is an important factor in job satisfaction, it is not the only motivation to make employees work harder. There are other factors that can be just as important in motivating employees, including job satisfaction, recognition, opportunities for growth, and a positive work environment.

The idea that paying more money is the only way to motivate employees assumes that all employees are primarily motivated by financial incentives. While this may be true for some employees, numerous studies have shown that many employees are equally or more motivated by non-financial incentives. For example, many employees are motivated by opportunities for promotions, engaging work, and a positive work environment.

Research has shown that a lack of job satisfaction is one of the main reasons why employees may not work as hard as they could. Creating a work environment where employees feel valued, supported, and recognized for their efforts can go a long way in increasing job satisfaction, improving morale, and motivating employees to work harder.

Moreover, recognition is a crucial motivator for employees. Recognizing employees' achievements, offering feedback, and incentivizing their hard work can have a positive impact on their motivation levels. They are much more likely to be motivated when their efforts and contributions are recognized and appreciated.

Opportunities for career growth and development also play a significant role in motivating employees. Employees seek out these opportunities because they allow them to learn new skills, take on new challenges and advance their careers. When employees see that their employer is investing in their development and are given access to professional development opportunities, motivation levels increase.

In conclusion, paying employees more money is not the only motivation to make them work harder. While pay is important, other factors such as job satisfaction, recognition, opportunities for growth, and a positive work environment play a crucial role in motivating employees. Therefore, employers should consider a holistic approach that combines both financial and non-financial incentives to ensure their employees are motivated to work harder and achieve their full potential.",Paying more money is the only motivation to make employees work harder,6.0,355.0,17.0,20.88235294117647,31.0,8.0,9.882352941176473,174.0,0.2957746478873239,0.1690140845070422,0.1211267605633802,0.0197183098591549,0.0197183098591549,19.0,0.1005291005291005,6.0,0.4120603015075377,350.0,151.13884619056338,1.0,-0.0346595570119679,151.10418663355142,13.8,15.8,15.03,3.670664543892298,0.322,0.027,0.651,55.0,0.0,0.4221105527638191,23,11,3,1.0
"Sporting events are one of the few platforms where people from different countries, cultures, and backgrounds come together to share a common experience. While the primary purpose of these events is to showcase athletic talent, they also have the potential to ease international tensions. Here are some ways in which sporting events promote unity, understanding, and peace among nations:

Firstly, sporting events facilitate cultural exchange. As athletes and fans from different countries come together, they get a chance to learn about each others' cultures, customs, and traditions. People get to know each other and celebrate their differences, which can help break down negative stereotypes and reduce the tensions that may exist between them. 

Secondly, sporting events promote diplomacy and reconciliation. During sporting events, nations that may be in tension and conflict with each other can set aside their differences and focus on supporting their teams. They have a chance to engage in peaceful interactions, facilitate dialogues, and bridge gaps, which can be the first step towards reconciliation and diplomatic relations.

Thirdly, sporting events create a sense of camaraderie and mutual respect between nations. Seeing athletes from different countries compete at the highest level and push each other to their limits can create feelings of admiration and respect. These feelings can be instrumental in reducing prejudice and strengthening relationships between nations.

Lastly, sporting events provide opportunities to promote important social issues. Sporting events can be used as a platform to raise awareness about social issues such as racism, gender inequality, and discrimination. The scale and significance of these events can draw attention to these issues and create a platform for dialogue, education, and advocacy.

In conclusion, sporting events can play a vital role in easing international tensions. They facilitate cultural exchange, promote diplomacy and reconciliation, create a sense of camaraderie and mutual respect between nations, and provide opportunities to address important social issues. Sporting events have the power to break down barriers and foster unity, understanding, peace, and cooperation among nations.",Sporting events easing international tensions,6.0,330.0,17.0,19.41176470588235,26.0,7.0,8.588235294117647,180.0,0.3333333333333333,0.1666666666666666,0.103030303030303,0.0151515151515151,0.0303030303030303,12.0,0.0652173913043478,6.706,0.4509283819628647,324.0,130.16444917141217,0.0,0.0,130.16444917141217,13.2,15.8,15.72,4.207705368679722,0.219,0.061,0.72,44.0,1.0,0.3872679045092838,14,7,2,1.0
"As the world's population and energy needs continue to grow, it is important that we find alternative sources of energy in order to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and minimize our carbon footprint. Governments around the world have a responsibility to promote alternative sources of energy, both for the benefit of the environment and for the well-being of their citizens. Here are some reasons why the government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy:

Firstly, alternative sources of energy, such as wind and solar power, are infinitely renewable. Unlike fossil fuels, which are finite and will eventually run out, renewable energy sources can be used indefinitely as long as the required infrastructure is in place. Encouraging the development and investment in infrastructure for alternative sources of energy can help provide a sustainable and long-lasting energy option.

Secondly, alternative energy sources can help mitigate climate change. The use of alternative sources of energy leads to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming. Governments can play a crucial role in promoting and incentivizing energy sources that produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions.

Thirdly, promoting alternative sources of energy can lead to job creation and economic growth. As the demand for renewable energy sources continues to grow, so too will the need for skilled workers to develop, install and operate related infrastructures. This can create job opportunities within the energy sector and other related industries, leading to economic growth.

Lastly, alternative sources of energy can lead to energy independence. Dependence on fossil fuels exposes a country to sudden price fluctuations and potential supply interruptions caused by market forces and political situations. Alternative energy sources can help countries become less vulnerable to future energy-related crises by reducing reliance on non-domestic energy sources.

In conclusion, the government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy. Encouraging the development and investment in infrastructure for alternative sources of energy can lead to sustainable and long-lasting energy options, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, create job opportunities, and provide energy independence. It is essential for governments to prioritize the promotion of alternative sources of energy for the benefit of current and future generations.",Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy,6.0,362.0,17.0,21.294117647058822,34.0,9.0,8.705882352941176,178.0,0.3508287292817679,0.1685082872928177,0.1243093922651933,0.0082872928176795,0.0359116022099447,24.0,0.109090909090909,6.389,0.4335839598997493,361.0,142.0063246217822,1.0,-0.0346595570119679,141.97166506477024,15.1,16.7,15.95,4.081040042017381,0.248,0.017,0.734,43.0,1.0,0.3709273182957393,50,22,4,1.0
"Governments around the world face the challenge of dealing with the issues of unemployment and homelessness. These issues can have a significant impact on individuals and communities, leading to social and economic problems. Governments have a moral responsibility to address these issues and to assist those who are unemployed and homeless. Here are some reasons why governments should be responsible for helping the unemployed and homeless:

Firstly, governments have a responsibility to provide basic needs to their citizens. The right to shelter is a basic human right, as is the right to work and make a living. When individuals are unemployed and homeless, they lack access to these basic needs, which can lead to poor health and social problems such as drug addiction and crime. Governments can provide support services such as housing, job placement, and education to help individuals access the resources they need to improve their lives.

Secondly, investing in programs that help the unemployed and homeless can have economic benefits for the government. Homelessness and unemployment are costly to society as they require investments in health care, social support services, and other programs. By investing in programs that help individuals find employment and housing, governments can reduce the burden on taxpayers and the economy, reduce crime rates, and increase overall economic productivity.

Thirdly, providing assistance to the unemployed and homeless can help prevent more people from becoming homeless and unemployed. Addressing the root causes of these issues, such as the lack of affordable housing and inadequate employment opportunities, can help prevent further cases of homelessness and unemployment.

Lastly, helping the unemployed and homeless is a moral responsibility. Governments have the obligation to support and protect their citizens. The unemployed and homeless are among the most vulnerable members of society and governments should make every effort to provide them with assistance.

In conclusion, governments have a moral responsibility to assist the unemployed and homeless. Helping them access basic needs such as shelter and work is important for the individuals and also has societal, economic, and moral benefits. Therefore, it is important for the government to invest in programs to help the unemployed and homeless find work and housing, and decrease the number of people facing homelessness and unemployment in the future.",Should governments be responsible to help the unemployed and homeless,6.0,373.0,18.0,20.72222222222222,34.0,10.0,9.77777777777778,169.0,0.2761394101876676,0.1474530831099195,0.1447721179624665,0.0187667560321715,0.0241286863270777,10.0,0.0507614213197969,6.333,0.3695652173913043,367.0,148.93141757445008,0.0,0.0,148.93141757445008,12.5,15.4,14.68,3.704444810481636,0.146,0.096,0.759,58.0,0.0,0.4251207729468599,12,6,2,1.0
"A university is often viewed as a place for students to acquire knowledge and skills, obtain a degree, and enter the workforce. While this is certainly an important function of a university, it is only one aspect of the true function of a university. Here are some other functions a university serves:

Firstly, a university serves as a space for critical thinking, reflection, and discovery. Universities provide an environment where students can engage in intellectual discussions, challenge their beliefs, and broaden their perspectives. They also create opportunities for research, experimentation and discovery, which can lead to innovation and advancements in various fields of study.

Secondly, universities serve to provide opportunities for personal growth and development. Universities often offer a range of extracurricular activities and resources that enable students to explore their interests, develop leadership skills, and participate in their communities. A university provides students with a chance to interact with a diverse group of people from different backgrounds and cultures, which fosters personal growth and the acquisition of important life skills such as leadership, communication, and teamwork.

Thirdly, a university serves to prepare students to be active and responsible citizens. Universities provide students with an education that emphasizes civic responsibility and leadership, and encourages students to engage in public service. This prepares students to become involved in their communities, to work towards social justice, and to be agents of change in society.

Lastly, a university serves as a repository of knowledge. Universities accumulate and preserve the knowledge of humanity, making it available for future generations. They also serve as a platform where ideas can be exchanged and debated, and where new ideas can be generated.

In conclusion, while a university serves the function of providing knowledge and skills to enter the workforce, its true function goes far beyond this narrow view. A university is a space for critical thinking, reflection, and discovery, and a place for personal growth and development. It prepares students to be active and responsible citizens and a repository of knowledge.

"Zoos play a vital role in conserving and protecting rare and endangered species that would otherwise become extinct. While many people believe that zoos are simply places for entertainment, the truth is that they have a much greater importance in terms of animal welfare, education, and conservation.

One of the primary reasons why zoos should be built is to protect rural animals from extinction. Many species of animals that live in rural areas are at risk of disappearing due to environmental factors such as habitat destruction, climate change, and human activities. Zoos play a critical role in ensuring the survival of these animals by providing them with safe and secure environments where they can breed and multiply.

Moreover, zoos have the resources and expertise to employ modern veterinary care and technologies to increase the success of breeding programs. Through breeding programs, zoos can restore the populations of endangered species and safeguard them for future generations. This also allows zoos to research and study the behaviour and biology of these rare animals in a way that would not be possible if they were simply left in the wild.

Another benefit of zoos is that they provide educational opportunities for the public to learn about these rare animals and the importance of conservation efforts to protect them. Zoos can host educational programs, tours, and exhibits that demonstrate the interdependent nature of ecosystems, and the crucial role that animals play in this intricate system. This education helps to raise awareness amongst visitors regarding the plight of many rural animals, instilling a sense of empathy and encouraging them to engage in conservation practices and support zoos that contribute to these efforts.

In conclusion, the importance of protecting rural animals cannot be stressed enough. Creating zoos that provide secure environments for these animals to thrive is a valuable solution to conserving endangered species and education the public about the importance of animal conservation efforts. Different initiatives to improve animal welfare in zoos must be implemented to create safe and comfortable environment for the animals. Thus, zoos should be built, and they should strive to foster the preservation of endangered species and contribute to educating society about the importance of conservation efforts.",zoos should be built to protect rural animals,5.0,366.0,15.0,24.4,36.0,12.0,11.666666666666666,185.0,0.2950819672131147,0.174863387978142,0.0928961748633879,0.0245901639344262,0.0273224043715847,10.0,0.0520833333333333,7.733,0.4469696969696969,362.0,142.087700952231,0.0,0.0,142.087700952231,14.0,16.6,14.34,4.1308034962031295,0.23,0.019,0.751,48.0,0.0,0.4419191919191919,2,1,2,1.0
"The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced the world to a new normal, where many aspects of daily life have shifted dramatically. Education is not an exception to this shift. Before the pandemic, attending school in person was the norm for most students. Now, many have been introduced to a new way of learning: distance-learning. While both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, this essay focuses on comparing distance-learning to attending school in person.

One of the primary advantages of attending school in person is the social aspect. Regular school attendance allows for face-to-face interaction with teachers, peers, and mentors, which many students find invaluable. The opportunity to engage in meaningful relationships, develop social skills and build friendships is critical to healthy development holistically. These important interactions are not easily replicated in an online setting, which quite often can lead to loneliness, social isolation and depression.

However, the need for social interaction in school has also become a possible disadvantage, especially during the current pandemic. With the need for social distancing and keeping to a limited number of people in one place to curb the spread of the virus, attending school in person could become life-threatening. Distance-learning offers a valuable alternative in promoting necessary distance to keep everyone safe from the virus. With online classes, students can learn from their homes and limit their contact with others, which reduces the spread of the virus.

Another significant advantage of distance learning is flexibility. Unlike attending school in person, students can access resources, and participate in class at their own pace and on their schedule. This means that students who have other commitments such as work, family, and other activities can fit them into their school routines conveniently without much of a conflict. The location and time barriers that tend to limit students from accessing education also diminish considerably in distance learning.

However, distance learning also poses challenges such as the lack of direct supervision by teachers, inadequate access to resources and technology, and the possibility of distractions at home. In an online environment, the responsibility for the learning process falls mainly on the student, and as such, requires good time management and discipline. Without adequate motivation or support, students may find it difficult to stay engaged and focused, leading to unsatisfactory academic progress.

In conclusion, both attending school in person and distance-learning have their pros and cons. While face-to-face interaction in school is a critical element to physical, emotional, and social development, there are advantages to distance learning that cannot be overlooked, mainly its flexibility and adaptability in the current pandemic. Ultimately the choice between the two methods must be based on the needs of the student and the available resources. By balancing these factors, a student can select the learning option best suited to their needs.",distance-learning vs. attending school in person,6.0,464.0,24.0,19.33333333333333,34.0,8.0,9.333333333333334,257.0,0.3275862068965517,0.1271551724137931,0.1099137931034482,0.0107758620689655,0.0193965517241379,11.0,0.044,6.125,0.4646271510516252,466.0,182.08743130766905,0.0,0.0,182.08743130766905,12.0,15.0,14.91,4.472881893246245,0.132,0.071,0.797,73.0,0.0,0.4282982791586998,2,1,2,1.0
"The advancements in communication technologies have been revolutionizing the way people interact with one another. The rise of social media platforms, video conferencing, and instant messaging has brought convenience and efficiency to communication. However, not all people benefit from the use of modern communication technologies.

One of the advantages of modern communication technologies is that they have made communication more accessible, particularly for people who live far apart. Distance is no longer a barrier to communication. People can remain connected despite differences in geographical location. For many, this has made communication fast and effective. The use of modern communication technologies has enabled people around the world to build networks, share ideas, and collaborate on projects regardless of their physical location.

Moreover, the use of modern communication technologies has made communication less expensive. Previously, communicating with people who lived far away used to be costly. Phone calls and sending letters via post were the only reliable means of communication, and they both involved costs that some people could not afford. Today, the situation has changed. With social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and instant messaging applications like WhatsApp, Viber, and Telegram, people can connect with their friends and family without incurring additional costs. This is especially important for people with limited resources who would otherwise have difficulty communicating with loved ones or seeking help when they need it.

However, not all people have access to modern communication technologies. In many developing countries, people from remote areas and those living in extreme poverty face challenges in accessing modern communication technologies. Limited access to the internet and the high cost of electronic devices make it difficult for some people to benefit from the use of modern communication technologies.

Furthermore, the information overload associated with modern communication technologies can be overwhelming for some people. With the vast amount of information available on the internet, it can be difficult for people to discern what is accurate and relevant. This is particularly true for vulnerable groups such as the elderly and young children who may not have the necessary tools to filter out inappropriate and misleading content.

In conclusion, while modern communication technologies have brought many benefits to communication for people worldwide, not all people have enjoyed these benefits. The digital divide has widened the gap between those who have access to modern communication technologies and those who do not. There is a need to bridge the gap by ensuring that everyone has equal access to communication technologies. This can be achieved through government intervention, which would include policies that promote the availability and affordability of telecommunications infrastructure in underserved regions. By addressing the challenges to accessing modern communication technologies, we can ensure that everyone can benefit from the advancements in communication technology.",Do modern communication technologies benefit all people,6.0,459.0,25.0,18.36,30.0,5.0,8.72,240.0,0.289760348583878,0.1198257080610021,0.1198257080610021,0.037037037037037,0.0239651416122004,21.0,0.0871369294605809,6.36,0.4518664047151277,450.0,189.6470523183384,3.0,-0.1499521980575945,189.4971001202808,14.0,15.8,16.59,4.430813460198851,0.091,0.068,0.84,64.0,0.0,0.4282907662082514,18,7,4,1.0

One of the primary benefits of music education is that it helps in enhancing creativity and problem-solving skills. Music involves the use of diverse elements such as melody, harmony, and rhythm, which require cognitive and emotional processing. Engaging in these processes helps students develop their ability to think creatively and constructively to solve problems. When students learn how to apply these creative processes in music, they can also transfer them to other areas of their academics and life.

Additionally, music education improves memory and concentration skills. Learning how to play an instrument or sing a song requires a lot of practice and repetition, which enhances students' memory capacity and ability to concentrate. These skills can help students in their academic work and personal lives.

Moreover, music education provides an avenue for students to express themselves in a non-verbal way. Learning how to read, write, and play music enables students to communicate thoughts, emotions, and aspirations in a less linear mode, which could reduce stress and anxiety.

However, the potential downside of making music lessons compulsory is that it could detract from other areas of academic work. Students may have interests, talents, or aspirations in other subjects, and being forced to take music lessons could reduce the time and energy they have to devote to their passions. Additionally, forcing students to take music lessons could lead to a lack of motivation, which could result in lack of improvement and even resentment toward the subject.

In conclusion, while music education has many benefits, it should not be obligatory for all students. Instead, high schools could offer music education as an elective for students who have an interest in pursuing it. This would allow students to take ownership of their academic journeys while still enjoying the tremendous benefits of music education. Moreover, high schools should be equipped with the necessary facilities and resources to provide quality music instruction to those who choose to enroll in music classes. As long as students have the option to take advantage of music education if they so desire, they can experience all the benefits that music learning has to offer.",Should high school make music lessons compulsory,6.0,401.0,20.0,20.05,30.0,8.0,9.7,210.0,0.3192019950124688,0.1795511221945137,0.0773067331670823,0.0324189526184538,0.0374064837905236,17.0,0.0809523809523809,6.1,0.4586129753914988,397.0,162.03223903345705,1.0,-0.0380992718389808,161.99413976161807,12.3,14.0,13.34,4.071896599848648,0.19,0.043,0.767,55.0,1.0,0.4340044742729306,2,1,2,1.0
"The rapid development of agriculture in recent years has been a double-edged sword. On the one hand, new technologies and practices have improved productivity, and new farming methods have made agriculture more sustainable. The developments and changes in agriculture have vast impacts on society, environment and the economy. This essay will discuss some of the pros and cons of the developments in agriculture.

One of the significant advantages of agricultural development is increased food production, which has the potential to address food security problems and reduce hunger in many parts of the world. With advanced technologies, larger quantities of crops and livestock can be farmed, and at a faster pace, this ensures that food demand is met, especially in times of unforeseen happenings like natural disasters that may disrupt food supply.

Another advantage is the enhancement in crop quality, which results in fewer pests and disease outbreaks. Farmers today can use various pest control measures to prevent and control pests, and the crops can be genetically modified to be more resistant to insect pests and other diseases. This means that harvest yields are healthier and can be offered for consumption without people worrying about consuming unhealthy produce.

Moreover, agricultural developments have created better employment opportunities. With the advancement of modern farming practices, the use of machines and technology requires workers with technologically inclined skills, which, when employed, evokes an increase in income and livelihoods.

However, the development in agriculture can also have harmful impacts on the environment and the community. The use of pesticides and other chemicals can cause water and soil pollution. Excessive use of fertilizers can harm the soil by leaching important nutrients out of it and making it incapable of supporting plant life. This is detrimental to the environment as it alters the natural ecosystem which in turn puts biodiversity at risk. Human health is also a risk factor in which runoff of chemicals like pesticides into drinking water can lead to water-borne diseases and negatively affect people's health.

Furthermore, intensive farming practices have led to the loss of many natural habitats and native animal species. The rearing of livestock, and the intensive farming of crops has led to deforestation and the depletion of natural habitats for biodiversity.

In conclusion, while there are significant advantages to recent developments in agriculture, there are also negative impacts on the environment, people, and animal lives. We need to find a balance, where alternative methods are used and implemented in farming practices that reduce the detrimental effects of agriculture on the natural environment, and promote sustainability in farming practices, which equally impacts the economy and society positively.",pros and cons of developments in agriculture,7.0,436.0,20.0,21.8,41.0,8.0,9.9,239.0,0.3486238532110092,0.1169724770642201,0.1032110091743119,0.0137614678899082,0.0229357798165137,7.0,0.0290456431535269,6.9,0.4688796680497925,432.0,156.51156434167495,0.0,0.0,156.51156434167495,13.0,16.0,14.74,4.535421861385972,0.136,0.06,0.804,67.0,2.0,0.4107883817427386,0,0,1,1.0
"In today's increasingly global world, English has become a widely spoken language all over the world. There are advantages and disadvantages for the prevalence of English. In this essay, we will discuss the upsides and downsides of the widespread of English.

One of the primary advantages of English's prevalence is that it is now a universal language used for communication in international settings. English is the language of international trade, business, and diplomacy. With the rise of globalization and the importance of communication on a global scale, English has become an essential tool for succeeding in these industries and positions. Its prevalence makes it easy for people who speak different native languages to communicate and work together despite the cultural diversity.

Moreover, the widespread prevalence of English has opened up many professional and academic opportunities for people, regardless of their nationalities. English is often the language used in international conferences, which means that scholars and researchers can share their findings and insights with their peers beyond their home countries. This allows for a larger academic domain for sharing and collaboration.

However, the prevalence of English also has a downside. For one, it can be a barrier to those who do not speak the language or do not have the resources to learn it. For example, people from non-English speaking countries often face difficulties in being accepted into international schools or universities because they lack English proficiency. This could, in turn, result in unequal opportunities in education and career prospects, which are dependent on good command of the English language. 

Another disadvantage of the prevalence of English is that it can lead to the loss of indigenous cultures and languages. The desire to learn and speak English can lead to the neglect of native languages and cultures and further result in their extinction. The loss of a language means the loss of a culture, literature, tradition, and history.

In conclusion, while the widespread prevalence of English has various advantages like at a business and academic level, it also has certain disadvantages such as excluding individuals who do not speak the language and leading to the loss of languages and cultures. As society becomes more globalized, the importance of the English language cannot be overstated. However, there is also a need to promote multilingualism and multiculturalism, preserve indigenous languages, and promote equal opportunities for all, regardless of their language proficiency.",advantages and disadvantages of the prevalent of English,6.0,398.0,20.0,19.9,42.0,9.0,10.7,198.0,0.2663316582914573,0.1055276381909547,0.0979899497487437,0.0326633165829145,0.0175879396984924,16.0,0.0851063829787234,6.25,0.4224719101123595,393.0,151.79031641676085,3.0,-0.2152262089936024,151.57509020776723,12.2,14.6,14.1,3.937619948111121,0.117,0.07,0.813,65.0,1.0,0.4808988764044943,8,4,2,1.0
"The relationship between humans and animals has been a subject of debate for years. Many people believe that humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit; others believe that animals have rights that should not be infringed upon. While there are valid arguments on both sides, ultimately, animals should be treated ethically, and their welfare should be a priority.

One argument for using animals for human benefit is that it is a natural way of life. Humans have used animals for food, clothing, and other necessities for thousands of years. There is an argument that this relationship has developed over time and is necessary to sustain human life. Additionally, it has been argued that certain research would be impossible without studying animals, and using animals for science is therefore necessary.

However, the counter-argument is that animals have fundamental rights that should be respected. Animals are living organisms with the ability to experience pain, pleasure, and a range of emotions. They should not be treated as mere commodities or objects for human use. Practices such as factory farming, animal testing, and using animals in entertainment are all practices that can infringe on the rights of animals and can subject them to cruelty and abuse.

Moreover, using animals for human benefit often entails suffering on their part. Animals are frequently kept in cruel conditions in factories and laboratories, and often they are subjected to painful procedures. Some argue that humans should not mistreat other living organisms to satisfy their needs, especially when this is no longer necessary.

In conclusion, using animals for human benefit is a complex topic. While there may be situations where using animals is necessary for medical research or for survival, the welfare of the animals should always be a priority. Humans should consider alternative solutions to animal usage, especially when it is not humane. While humans and animals have coexisted for thousands of years, animal rights should always be considered and weighed against human needs. Ultimately, humans should treat animals with respect and kindness and strive to coexist with them in a way that is mutually beneficial.",humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit?,5.0,352.0,19.0,18.526315789473685,31.0,11.0,10.0,172.0,0.2926136363636363,0.1477272727272727,0.0823863636363636,0.0284090909090909,0.0426136363636363,17.0,0.1042944785276073,5.632,0.4311224489795918,347.0,146.76450179357118,1.0,-0.1838796512597445,146.58062214231143,11.7,12.8,12.88,3.683835073624085,0.113,0.09,0.797,56.0,0.0,0.4846938775510204,5,2,3,1.0
"Museums and art galleries have been the cornerstones of art and culture preservation for decades. They have been essential to preserving historical artifacts, documents, and artworks for future generations to enjoy and learn from. However, with the growth of digital technology, some people are starting to question whether museums and art galleries will disappear soon. 

While digital technology has many advantages, it is unlikely that museums and art galleries will disappear soon. One of the primary benefits of having museums and art galleries is that they create a sense of community and shared experiences around art. Art can evoke powerful emotions and ideas, and it is much more impactful to experience art in person than through digital media. The act of visiting a museum or gallery, sharing the space with other people, and experiencing the artwork together is part of what makes art so special and meaningful.

Moreover, museums and art galleries are essential in preserving cultural heritage. They are testament to the past and landmarks for future generations to learn from, understand and foster the appreciation for a countryâ€™s or areaâ€™s history and culture. Digital media may offer access to images of artwork and artifacts, but it cannot replicate the experience of seeing and, in some cases, touching them in person. The tactile nature of museums and galleries provide a deeper understanding of the culture from which the artwork or artifact originated.

Additionally, museums and art galleries are educational institutions that serve to inspire and educate future generations. They inspire curiosity and creativity and enrich peopleâ€™s understanding of history, art, and different cultures. They offer opportunities to learn about the cultural and historical backgrounds and experiences of local and transcendent human experiences.

However, it is undeniable that digital technology will continue to play an increasingly significant role in the art and heritage field. As museums and art galleries become more tech-savvy, they must embrace the use of digital tools, media, and networking to present collections and exhibitions in novel and interactive ways, making it easier to access by all who have an interest in the museum or gallery. In these ways, technology can enhance the museum experience and make art more accessible to everyone.

In conclusion, it is doubtful that museums and art galleries will disappear altogether. Museums and art galleries play a vital role in preserving and celebrating cultural heritage, promoting education, and creating meaningful human experiences around art. Technology will certainly play a significant role in the future of museums and art galleries, but it should be seen as an extension of their purpose, enabling museums and galleries to provide richer and more accessible experiences.",museums and art galleries will disappear soon?,6.0,438.0,20.0,21.9,45.0,11.0,10.45,216.0,0.3105022831050228,0.1415525114155251,0.1073059360730593,0.0388127853881278,0.0251141552511415,18.0,0.0769230769230769,6.25,0.4065040650406504,437.0,170.6524851840487,0.0,0.0,170.6524851840487,14.2,15.4,13.92,4.040541601218189,0.181,0.017,0.802,76.0,0.0,0.4247967479674797,12,5,3,1.0

"The debate about whether universities should accept equal numbers of males and females is a contentious one. While some argue that it is important for universities to strive for gender balance in their student populations, others believe that admission policies should be based solely on merit. In my opinion, while gender balance is an important consideration, universities should ultimately admit students based on their academic qualifications and potential.

One argument in support of accepting equal numbers of males and females is that it creates a more diverse and inclusive learning environment. When there is a balance of genders in a learning environment, students are exposed to different perspectives and experiences, which can enrich their learning and broaden their understanding of issues and ideas. By ensuring that both men and women have equal opportunities to pursue higher education, universities can help to break down gender barriers and promote equality.

However, some argue that admissions policies should be based solely on academic merit and potential. They argue that accepting students based on their gender could result in less qualified students being admitted over more qualified students simply based on their gender, which could ultimately harm the reputation of the university. When universities prioritize gender balance over merit, they risk sacrificing academic rigor and excellence.

Moreover, studies have shown that gender balance does not necessarily lead to better outcomes for students. A study by the Higher Education Policy Institute in the UK found that there was no significant difference in the academic performance of male-dominated courses compared to female-dominated courses. This suggests that gender balance may not have a significant impact on the quality of education that students receive.

In conclusion, while it is important for universities to strive towards gender balance and to promote equality, admissions policies should ultimately be based on academic merit and potential. Accepting or rejecting students based purely on their gender is not only unfair, but also detrimental to the quality of education that universities provide. By prioritizing academic excellence over gender balance, universities can create the best learning environment for their students and promote a culture of excellence and achievement.",should universities accept equal number of males/females or not,5.0,353.0,15.0,23.53333333333333,35.0,14.0,10.933333333333334,176.0,0.3059490084985836,0.1643059490084986,0.0708215297450425,0.0198300283286118,0.0311614730878186,11.0,0.0575916230366492,6.333,0.4371727748691099,350.0,137.16516480927686,0.0,0.0,137.16516480927686,14.8,17.4,15.79,3.732001486657504,0.17,0.044,0.787,56.0,0.0,0.4293193717277487,20,10,2,1.0
"In today's fast-paced world, people's lives have become increasingly busy, with busy work schedules and hectic lifestyles. As a result, many people have less time to cook meals for themselves and their families. The development of modern technologies and the emergence of new food trends have made it possible for people to spend less time cooking and still enjoy delicious meals.

The rise of fast food restaurants, convenience stores, and meal delivery services has provided people with more options for quick and easy meals. These options allow people to spend less time cooking and more time pursuing other activities. For instance, busy parents can enjoy quality time with their children instead of spending hours preparing food.

Moreover, new cooking technologies such as pressure cookers, slow cookers, and high-speed blenders have made it possible for people to prepare meals quickly and easily. These appliances have designed to reduce the time and effort required in cooking, allowing people to spend their limited time on more important activities.

In addition, the internet has made it easier for people to access recipes, cooking tips, and meal planning resources. Social media platforms, cooking blogs, and recipe-sharing websites have made it possible for people to learn about new cuisines and cooking techniques, making it easier for them to cook healthy and delicious meals in less time.

However, while new technologies and food trends have made it possible for people to spend less time cooking, they can also have negative impacts on health and nutrition. Many fast food options are high in calories, fat, and sodium, which can lead to obesity, high blood pressure, and other health problems. It is important to strike a balance between convenience and nutrition.

"Traditional games and modern games both have their own advantages and disadvantages when it comes to developing children's skills. Traditional games have been played for generations and can help children develop important skills such as teamwork, problem-solving, and critical thinking. Modern games, on the other hand, can help children develop skills such as hand-eye coordination, strategic thinking, and technology literacy. Let's explore how each type of game can benefit children's skills development.

Traditional games such as hide-and-seek, tag, and hopscotch have been played by children for generations. These games often require cooperation and communication among different players and can help children develop important social skills such as teamwork and negotiation. Traditional games are usually simple, easy to understand, and accessible to children, which can encourage them to play and explore. Moreover, traditional games often do not require any equipment, and children can play them anywhere and at any time.

Modern games, on the other hand, have their own advantages in skill development. Video games, for instance, can help children develop hand-eye coordination skills and fine motor skills, as well as cognitive skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and strategic thinking. Many modern games require interaction and cooperation with others, which can help children develop social skills such as teamwork, communication, and empathy. Additionally, technology is an integral part of modern life, and learning to use technology and navigate digital platforms is an essential skill for children today.

However, it's important to note that some modern games can also have negative effects on children's skill development. Many video games can be addictive, and spending too much time playing them could affect academic performance, physical health, and social skills. Moreover, children who spend too much time on screens may miss out on important real-life experiences and social interactions.

In conclusion, both traditional and modern games have their own unique benefits and can help children develop important skills. Traditional games can help children develop teamwork, problem-solving, and critical thinking skills, while modern games can help children develop hand-eye coordination, cognitive skills, and technology literacy. Therefore, parents and educators should aim to provide a balance of both traditional and modern games to promote optimal skill development in children.",Traditional games or modern games in developing children's skills,5.0,364.0,18.0,20.22222222222222,28.0,12.0,8.666666666666666,169.0,0.3461538461538461,0.1758241758241758,0.173076923076923,0.0192307692307692,0.0439560439560439,17.0,0.0765765765765765,5.944,0.3679245283018867,371.0,151.7577692626014,2.0,-0.1259940953280925,151.63177516727333,13.5,16.6,16.01,3.4751641165348794,0.178,0.036,0.786,60.0,0.0,0.3679245283018867,26,12,3,1.0
"The government should not invest money in building theaters or sports stadiums when there are more pressing needs in society such as education, healthcare, infrastructure, and social welfare. While sports events and cultural activities can contribute to the social and economic growth of a community, the long-term benefits of these facilities are often outweighed by the costs and the limited reach of their benefits.

First, building theaters or sports stadiums requires a significant amount of public funds, which could be spent on more pressing needs. The construction and maintenance of these facilities are often expensive, and the money spent on them could be better used to improve the quality of life for the citizens in other areas.

Second, these facilities often cater to a minority group of people, excluding others who may not be interested in sports or cultural events. Sports stadiums often host professional teams or events, which only appeals to a small group of people. Similarly, theaters and cultural venues may not appeal to everyone, particularly those from lower-income groups, who may not have the means to attend cultural events.

Thirdly, government investment in stadiums and theaters may lead to negative environmental and social effects. The construction of a large stadium or theater complex requires vast amounts of land and may disrupt natural habitats, leading to environmental degradation. Additionally, the increased traffic and noise pollution from these facilities can create a disturbance for local residents.

Overall, while sports and cultural events can be an important component of a community, it is not the government's primary role to fund their construction. Instead, governments should prioritize spending public funds on areas that are essential for the well-being of a community, such as education, healthcare, infrastructure, and social welfare.

"Technology has had both positive and negative impacts on traditional skills and ways of life. On the one hand, technology has made it easier and more efficient to maintain and pass on traditional skills and knowledge. On the other hand, technology has also led to a loss of traditional practices and skills because it has made them less relevant or not as important.

One of the positive impacts of technology is that it has facilitated the preservation and transmission of traditional knowledge. Technology has made it easier to document and share traditional practices, skills, and knowledge, making it possible for people to learn about and appreciate traditional ways of life. For example, online platforms, such as YouTube and social media, have made it possible to share and learn traditional skills, recipes, and crafts from various cultures around the world.

Moreover, technology has created new tools and techniques to support traditional practices. For example, modern tools, such as modern farming equipment, have made it easier for farmers to cultivate and harvest crops, increasing their productivity and profitability. Likewise, modern technology has also made it easier for artisans to create intricate, high-quality crafts with greater precision and accuracy.

However, technology has also led to a decline in traditional practices and skills. The emergence of modern lifestyles, such as urbanization and globalization, has made traditional practices less relevant and harder to sustain. As a result, younger generations may lose interest in learning traditional skills, and the knowledge may eventually disappear.

Moreover, technology has also introduced new practices, which can replace traditional ones. For example, the use of metal and plastic utensils for cooking and eating have replaced traditional ones made of leaves, coconut shells, or bamboo. Similarly, modern medicine has replaced traditional healing practices in many parts of the world.

In conclusion, while technology has facilitated the preservation and transmission of traditional practices, skills, and knowledge, it has also caused the loss of traditional practices and made traditional skills and knowledge less relevant. Therefore, it is essential to embrace technology while valuing and preserving traditional practices and knowledge so that they can be passed down to future generations. By doing so, we can ensure that traditional ways of life remain relevant and valued, thereby enriching our cultural heritage.",Technology keeps traditional skills and ways of life alive or not?,6.0,375.0,18.0,20.83333333333333,33.0,12.0,10.055555555555555,178.0,0.2746666666666666,0.136,0.1573333333333333,0.0346666666666666,0.0133333333333333,19.0,0.0974358974358974,5.611,0.3925233644859813,370.0,151.0236711839293,0.0,0.0,151.0236711839293,13.8,15.7,14.79,3.8760635137977766,0.147,0.035,0.819,73.0,0.0,0.4228971962616822,18,9,2,1.0
"Creative artists are essential contributors to society, with their work enriching our culture and providing us with new perspectives and insights into the human experience. Creative artists come in different forms, such as writers, musicians, painters, actors, and filmmakers.

The work of creative artists has many benefits for society. Firstly, they help us to appreciate the diversity and richness of human culture. Creative artists often draw inspiration from their experiences and exposure to different cultures, which helps to promote cross-cultural understanding and mutual respect.

Secondly, creative artists provide us with new perspectives and insights into the human experience. Their work can challenge our assumptions and force us to think critically about the world around us. They can help us to explore complex emotions such as love, loss, and hope, and can provoke conversations and debates about social and political issues.

Thirdly, creative artists help to create a sense of community and connectedness. Their work can bring people together, creating shared experiences and memories. For example, live performances, public art, and community events can all bring people together, irrespective of race, religion, or background.

Moreover, creative artists can inspire future generations to pursue their passions and creative endeavors. They serve as role models and advocates for artistic expression, helping to cultivate a society that values creativity, individuality, and diversity.

However, the life of a creative artist can be challenging and uncertain. Many creative artists struggle to make their work profitable or to find regular employment opportunities. Moreover, some forms of art, such as music and writing, are prone to issues with intellectual property laws and piracy, which could deprive artists of the financial benefits of their work.

In conclusion, creative artists play an essential role in enriching our culture and providing us with new perspectives on the world. Their work promotes cross-cultural understanding, challenges our assumptions, and inspires us to pursue our passions. Governments and societies should support and value the work of creative artists and provide them with the resources and opportunities they need to thrive and contribute to society.",Creative Artists,7.0,340.0,19.0,17.894736842105264,31.0,10.0,7.736842105263157,186.0,0.3117647058823529,0.1558823529411764,0.1411764705882353,0.038235294117647,0.0264705882352941,11.0,0.0564102564102564,6.211,0.4475703324808184,335.0,134.13294419696476,0.0,0.0,134.13294419696476,11.5,14.7,15.02,4.147797622902246,0.296,0.03,0.674,53.0,0.0,0.3759590792838874,22,11,2,1.0
"The role of the government in controlling media crime is a topic of ongoing debate. While media crime poses major risks to society, governments should not exert excessive control over the media as this could lead to censorship and violation of the freedom of the press.

Media crime refers to any illegal activity or behavior engaged in by media organizations, journalists, or broadcasters. Such activities may include invasion of privacy, defamation, copyright infringement, plagiarism, and propaganda, among others.

While it is essential to have laws and regulations in place to combat media crime, it is equally important to protect the freedom of the press and prevent censorship. Governments should prioritize creating a balance between protecting the public and upholding freedom of expression.

One way in which the government can help control media crime is by enforcing existing laws and regulations. This could be done through monitoring the media and taking legal action against any organization or individual involved in illegal activities. Governments should also provide proper training and education to journalists, broadcasters, and media organizations to raise awareness about media crime and prevent such acts from occurring in the first place.

Moreover, media outlets should have effective mechanisms in place to ensure transparency, accountability, and ethical behavior. Media self-regulation is one way of achieving this, where the media industry monitors itself and takes action against any member found engaging in unethical behavior.

However, the government should be cautious in its approach to controlling media crime, as excessive control could infringe upon the freedom of the press and censor vital information. Governments should avoid using media crime as an excuse to suppress freedom of expression and control the media.

In conclusion, the government has a role to play in controlling media crime, but it should not use this as an excuse to exert excessive control over the media. Government should work towards creating the right balance between protecting the public from media crime, promoting ethical media practices, and safeguarding the freedom of the press. With appropriate laws and regulations in place, along with education, training, and effective self-regulation, we can minimize media crime and ensure that the media functions as a responsible and valuable part of society.",should goverment control media crime,7.0,366.0,16.0,22.875,33.0,15.0,10.5,188.0,0.360655737704918,0.1721311475409836,0.0683060109289617,0.0136612021857923,0.0382513661202185,20.0,0.1,7.062,0.4250614250614251,361.0,143.0638942850576,0.0,0.0,143.0638942850576,14.6,16.4,14.86,3.883175207976784,0.167,0.116,0.717,54.0,0.0,0.4127764127764127,14,6,4,1.0
"Over the years, the world has witnessed a significant shift in the way women are perceived, and the opportunities available to them. In the past, women had limited options in terms of education, career, and societal roles. They were expected to marry early, have children, and manage the home. However, times have changed, and women are now enjoying more opportunities than ever before.

One of the main reasons why there are more opportunities for women today is because of increased access to education. In the past, women were not encouraged to pursue higher education as it was believed that their role was to get married and raise children. However, nowadays, women are encouraged to receive quality education and training in various fields. As a result, women can now choose from a variety of careers and have access to higher-paying jobs that were once reserved for men.

Additionally, with the changing times and increased awareness about women's rights, society has become more inclusive. The introduction of laws that protect women's rights and ensure equal opportunities in the workplace has been a significant step forward. More women are now serving in top positions in various fields, ranging from politics to business, which further empowers and motivates other women to aspire to leadership positions.

Furthermore, technology has played a crucial role in bridging the gender gap by providing more remote opportunities and work flexibility. Women now have the option to work from home, access online education, and operate their businesses and ventures through the internet. This flexibility has provided ample opportunities for women to achieve work-life balance and prioritize their families while still pursuing their careers.

In conclusion, the strides made in education, the introduction of laws that protect women's rights, and technological advancements have enabled women to access more opportunities than ever before. Despite the gains made, there is still more to be done, and society must continue to make efforts to level the playing field for everyone irrespective of gender. As a society, we must keep striving to provide equal opportunities to all, regardless of their gender.",Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past,5.0,346.0,17.0,20.352941176470587,28.0,12.0,10.647058823529411,193.0,0.2947976878612717,0.1531791907514451,0.0722543352601156,0.0202312138728323,0.0086705202312138,14.0,0.0823529411764705,6.529,0.465648854961832,346.0,140.3513150220096,0.0,0.0,140.3513150220096,12.4,14.0,13.05,4.051850567749545,0.135,0.022,0.843,53.0,0.0,0.460559796437659,14,7,2,1.0
"Traffic congestion and pollution are two significant issues that have long been associated with higher levels of petrol consumption in urban areas. As the number of vehicles on the road grows, so does air pollution and carbon emissions. However, one solution that has been proposed to curb this problem is to increase petrol prices. This essay seeks to identify the benefits and drawbacks of such a proposal.

One significant advantage of raising petrol prices is that it could lead to a reduction in traffic congestion. Higher petrol prices would encourage people to think about their driving habits and prioritize essential trips rather than using their cars for non-essential purposes. This could lead to less congestion on the roads, a reduction in road accidents, and overall a safer driving experience for everyone.

Moreover, a higher petrol price may lead to people adopting more environmentally friendly modes of transportation. For example, people may start cycling or walking more, and public transportation may become more attractive. This can also lead to a reduced level of pollution in urban areas. A shift to public transportation and other alternative modes of travel would also positively impact the economy as it lowers the cost of maintaining infrastructure and reduces the amount spent on petrol.

On the other hand, an increase in petrol prices could be disadvantageous to those with limited incomes or those who need to drive for work or other essential purposes. People with lower incomes could be particularly affected by such a measure as they may not have the resources to switch to more environmentally friendly modes of transportation or alternative fuel vehicles. Furthermore, rising petrol prices could lead to higher domestic fuel bills, which could be challenging for households trying to balance their finances.

In conclusion, increasing the price of petrol could have several benefits, including reducing traffic congestion and lowering carbon emissions while helping to preserve the environment. However, it is essential to balance environmental concerns with the practical needs of people who need to drive for work or other essential purposes. Policymakers need to be cautious in implementing such a measure and ensure that it does not adversely affect those who are already struggling. Education and incentives for the use of alternative modes of transportation should also be provided to encourage people to adopt more sustainable habits.",Growing traffic & pollution can be controlled by increasing petrol prices,5.0,386.0,18.0,21.444444444444443,32.0,13.0,10.555555555555555,199.0,0.2772020725388601,0.1735751295336787,0.1062176165803108,0.0233160621761658,0.038860103626943,9.0,0.0456852791878172,7.389,0.460431654676259,382.0,154.80507921467563,0.0,0.0,154.80507921467563,12.8,14.8,13.63,4.2483272798587794,0.135,0.052,0.813,53.0,0.0,0.4556354916067146,16,8,2,1.0
"Advertisements play an essential role in today's consumer-driven society, and they are seen everywhere - on television, billboards, magazines, and social media platforms. Some people argue that advertisements should be banned altogether. However, such a move could have many adverse effects on businesses, the economy, and even consumers. This essay will explore the arguments for and against banning advertisements.

One critical argument in favor of banning advertisements is that it could help reduce the overall consumption of goods and services. Advertisements often seek to create demand for products that consumers don't need. Many people see this as a form of manipulation and argue that it contributes to unhealthy consumerism. By banning ads, people will be less likely to spend money unnecessarily, which could help in preserving the environment and reducing the carbon footprint.

Moreover, children are often vulnerable to the effects of advertisements, which could impact their cognitive development. Advertisements often target children with messages about toys, junk food, and other products that they may not need or that could be harmful to their health. Banning ads that target children could help protect the young from such manipulation and promote healthy consumption choices.

On the other hand, there are several arguments against banning advertisements. For one, ads promote business growth, which is essential for the overall health of the economy. Many companies rely on ads to reach out to their target audience, and without ads, they may have difficulty finding customers, which could lead to job losses and economic instability.

Furthermore, advertisements provide important information to consumers that helps them make informed decisions about the products they buy. Ads contain detailed information about product features, prices, and availability, which makes it easy for people to compare products and make better purchasing decisions. In this sense, advertisements can be seen as an important source of information for consumers.

In conclusion, while it is understandable why some people may advocate for the banning of advertisements, it is essential to look at the bigger picture. Banning ads altogether could have severe economic consequences and limit the information available to consumers, which could impact their decision-making abilities. Instead, we should advocate for responsible advertising that does not manipulate or target vulnerable groups, minors, or generate frustration in the environment.",should all the advertisements be banned?,6.0,375.0,20.0,18.75,30.0,9.0,9.15,208.0,0.296,0.1893333333333333,0.096,0.032,0.0453333333333333,8.0,0.041025641025641,6.6,0.4707259953161593,372.0,156.9774136711974,0.0,0.0,156.9774136711974,11.8,15.2,15.49,4.113327203301337,0.115,0.104,0.781,49.0,0.0,0.4285714285714285,0,0,1,1.0
"Drug abuse is a complex and multifaceted problem that affects many people globally. While it is essential to address drug addiction, enforcing universal prison sentences for drug users is a misguided approach that does not address the underlying issues that lead to addiction. In this essay, we will examine the arguments for and against automatically sending drug users to prison.

On the one hand, advocates of this approach argue that prison sentences will act as a deterrent to drug users. The punishment of imprisonment is hoped to deter people from trying drugs in the first place and discourage current users from continuing their drug use. This is supported by the argument that if drug users feel there will be a stiff penalty for their drug abuse, they may change their behaviour to avoid being sent to jail. Others argue that being in prison will help drug users to understand the negative effects of their addiction and allow them to reform.

On the other hand, there are several reasons why this approach may not work. Firstly, drug addiction is a complex issue that goes beyond simply making a conscious choice to engage in drug use. Addiction often arises because of underlying problems, such as mental health issues or societal factors, and punishing drug users without addressing these issues is unlikely to lead to lasting change.

Moreover, mandatory imprisonment will burden the criminal justice system, overcrowd prisons, and waste public funds. Incarceration is an expensive solution that does not address the root cause of the problem. Instead of investing in more effective approaches that address addiction's underlying causes, mandatory sentences will drain resources that could have been used to address the issue more holistically.

In conclusion, while the idea of automatically sending drug users to prison may seem like a solution, it is in fact shortsighted and ineffective in addressing the issue of drug addiction. Prison sentences do nothing to address the causes of addiction and will lead to overcrowding in jails without providing a long-term solution. Instead, society's approach should be to invest in rehabilitation and addressing the underlying problems that lead to addiction. By doing so, we can help drug users to find a way out of their addiction and get them back on track to leading a healthy, substance-free life.",Those who use drugs should be automatically sentenced to time in prison,5.0,381.0,17.0,22.41176470588235,32.0,13.0,10.882352941176473,204.0,0.2913385826771653,0.1863517060367454,0.0839895013123359,0.0262467191601049,0.0341207349081364,14.0,0.07,6.294,0.4652278177458033,378.0,152.73907144721062,2.0,-0.1108841677863484,152.62818727942428,12.0,14.2,12.54,3.9446142341688937,0.105,0.174,0.721,45.0,1.0,0.4436450839328537,6,3,2,1.0
"The power of image and the written word has been a long-debated topic. While both have the ability to influence the reader or viewer, there are compelling arguments to suggest that images are more powerful than the written word. In this essay, we will explore these arguments and examine why we believe that images can often have more profound effects than the written word.

Firstly, an image is capable of evoking deep emotions within a person, that may be hard to replicate using the written word. Images can immediately capture the viewer's attention and evoke emotions without requiring a reader to interpret and analyze them. For example, when someone sees a photo of a child suffering from malnutrition, the image can evoke strong feelings of sadness, empathy, and compassion instantly. In contrast, reading about a child suffering from malnutrition may create a more cerebral response that lacks the emotional depth that an image generates.

Secondly, images are more memorable than the written word. Various studies have shown that people recall images better and longer than text, making them a more effective way of communicating a message. Photographs, art, and advertisements use images to convey a story or message, whereas the written word may not have the same recall value, especially with the rise of short attention spans, memes, and social media.

Thirdly, images can reach a broader audience than the written word, regardless of language barriers. Images hold a universal appeal and can communicate a message across cultures, regardless of language and literacy levels. In contrast, reading relies on language proficiency, and a person who is not fluent in a particular language may fail to understand a written message's nuances.

Lastly, a picture can tell a story in seconds, easy to understand, and less time-consuming than reading a piece of text. For example, the popularity of social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok, where images or short clips tell stories, demonstrate that image-rich content is more appealing and accessible than its textual counterparts.

In conclusion, images have proven to be a more powerful tool than the written word. While the written word can present complex ideas and narratives, images evoke emotions, are more memorable, accessible, and can appeal to a broader audience. In today's fast-moving world, where time and attention have become a scarce resource, images that can be understood at a glance and evoke an emotional response will remain a powerful tool to achieve communication objectives.",Is image more powerful than the written word?,6.0,407.0,18.0,22.61111111111111,35.0,9.0,10.555555555555555,215.0,0.2899262899262899,0.1842751842751842,0.0884520884520884,0.0171990171990172,0.0368550368550368,10.0,0.0446428571428571,6.278,0.4362850971922246,406.0,156.01958972012156,0.0,0.0,156.01958972012156,12.1,14.8,12.83,4.228274392666989,0.109,0.046,0.846,46.0,0.0,0.4103671706263499,2,1,2,1.0
"Language is an important cultural element that not only helps us communicate, but also reflects our history, culture, and traditions. However, several languages worldwide are in danger of going extinct due to various reasons. This essay will explore the importance of language preservation and the reasons behind the extinction of languages.

Firstly, languages play a vital role in cultural preservation. Language reflects the culture, history, and values of a community. When a language dies out, so does a unique cultural identity. By preserving languages, we can keep alive the rich cultural heritage and traditions that are tied to it.

Sadly, many factors contribute to language extinction. One of the significant contributors is globalization, which has led to the dominance of certain languages. Many indigenous languages are threatened by the prevalence of dominant languages such as English, Spanish and Chinese, as they are perceived to be more useful for communication and commercial transactions.

Additionally, language shifts among younger generations have given way to the dominance of dominant languages, as younger people choose to learn languages spoken in larger cities or countries. This adds to the lack of motivation among the younger generation to continue speaking their language, thereby decreasing its use until it eventually dies out.

Climate changes and the environment can also contribute to language extinction. Small communities situated in unique ecological systems that rely on specific flora and fauna may find that their languages are not necessary as the environment changes. As people adapt to a new environment, the language passed down to them will lose its purpose and finally die out.

In conclusion, language extinction is a serious problem that undermines cultural heritage and can disrupt the traditional ways of life. Policy-makers and concerned parties must factor in language preservation in education, culture, and tourism as a means of preserving languages and cultures. Governments or advocates for language protection should provide incentives for teaching and learning endangered languages, documenting the languages, and supporting the communities that speak them. It is essential for us to recognize the significance of minority languages and take actionable steps to preserve them.",Several languages are in danger of extinction,6.0,349.0,19.0,18.36842105263158,30.0,7.0,8.631578947368421,207.0,0.2893982808022922,0.154727793696275,0.1117478510028653,0.0286532951289398,0.0229226361031518,14.0,0.075268817204301,5.421,0.5051282051282051,344.0,133.19442733912817,0.0,0.0,133.19442733912817,11.6,14.6,15.03,4.0399385790104105,0.13,0.084,0.786,49.0,0.0,0.4205128205128205,0,0,1,1.0
"Art and music have been an integral part of human civilization for centuries. They provide numerous benefits that can improve the quality of life for individuals and society as a whole. In this essay, we will explore some of the key advantages of art and music that contribute to quality of life.

To begin with, one of the most obvious advantages of art and music is their ability to give pleasure to the audience or consumer. Art and music can uplift people's moods, reduce stress levels, and improve mental well-being. Music, in particular, has been shown to have an immediate effect on one's mood, with certain types of music having calming effects. 

Furthermore, art and music contribute to the development of critical thinking, creativity, and self-expression. In children, exposure to art and music has been found to correlate with higher levels of creativity, better social development, and increased cognitive function. In adults, exposure to art and music can help individuals develop critical thinking skills and improve their decision-making abilities.

Additionally, art and music serve as a means of cultural preservation, reflecting unique traditions and values that contribute to society's identity. They offer a window into the experience of different people, cultures, and historical periods. Through art and music, people can learn about their own culture and the cultures of others, fostering an enriched understanding of the human experience.

Moreover, art and music are universal languages, providing a means to connect with others and promote international understanding. Music and art can transcend language and cultural barriers, fostering an appreciation of diversity and encouraging positive social interaction.

In conclusion, art and music have significant advantages that contribute to individual and societal well-being, improving the quality of life in numerous ways. They have a powerful influence on people's moods, creativity, critical thinking abilities, and cultural identity. Through art and music, people can connect with others, understand different cultures, and promote international communication. It is therefore significant to continue promoting art and music education and supporting artists and musicians to ensure that these benefits are retained for future generations.",Do arts and music improve the quality of life?,6.0,345.0,18.0,19.166666666666668,26.0,13.0,8.722222222222221,181.0,0.3594202898550724,0.1420289855072463,0.1101449275362318,0.0144927536231884,0.0202898550724637,14.0,0.0714285714285714,6.0,0.4195979899497487,347.0,140.19518191663187,0.0,0.0,140.19518191663187,14.3,15.0,14.85,4.004692557725941,0.221,0.024,0.755,52.0,1.0,0.3944723618090452,8,4,2,1.0
"Education and healthcare are two vital aspects of any country's growth and development. While some argue that the government should be responsible for providing education and healthcare, others believe that these should be left to the private sector. In this essay, we will examine both sides of the argument and discuss why we believe the government should take responsibility for education and healthcare.

Firstly, education and healthcare are public goods that benefit everyone in society. Education enables people to participate in the economy, innovate, and contribute to growth and development. Without education, people are less likely to be productive members of society, which could lead to societal and economic problems. Similarly, healthcare enables people to maintain their health and wellbeing, which is essential for overall productivity in society. Therefore, the government should step in to provide education and healthcare to ensure that everyone has a fair chance to succeed and participate in the economy.

Moreover, education and healthcare are expensive commodities, and not everyone can afford to pay for them. By leaving education and healthcare in the hands of the private sector, the government would be creating a system of inequality where only the wealthy could access the best educational and healthcare services. Such a system would be unfair and unjust, as everyone deserves the same chance to succeed.

Furthermore, the government is best suited to ensure that these public goods are accessible to all citizens. The government can create policies and laws that ensure equal access to education and healthcare, thereby ensuring that all citizens can enjoy these public goods regardless of their socioeconomic status.

On the other hand, opponents of government intervention argue that the government is inefficient, and often creates a bloated bureaucracy that does not work efficiently. Private sector involvement, on the other hand, is often more efficient as businesses are focused on providing high-quality services to their customers.

In conclusion, while there is an argument to be made for private sector involvement in education and healthcare, we believe that the government has a responsibility to ensure that all citizens have access to these public goods. Education and healthcare are fundamental rights, and the government should take responsibility for providing them to ensure that everyone has a fair chance to succeed and lead a healthy life. The government should also ensure that the provision of education and healthcare is efficient and effective to make the best use of public resources.",Government should be responsible for education and health care or not?,6.0,404.0,18.0,22.444444444444443,37.0,12.0,11.833333333333334,181.0,0.2623762376237624,0.1534653465346534,0.1014851485148514,0.0272277227722772,0.0346534653465346,13.0,0.0673575129533678,6.556,0.3834080717488789,400.0,170.1962485544319,0.0,0.0,170.1962485544319,14.4,15.8,14.51,3.8615964353507097,0.21,0.048,0.743,59.0,0.0,0.4775784753363228,18,9,2,1.0
"Zoos have been a popular destination for families and animal enthusiasts for many years. On the surface, they seem like a great way to educate people about animals and conservation efforts, as well as provide entertainment. However, when we look deeper, we realize that zoos may actually be doing more harm than good. Therefore, I believe that zoos should be banned.

The first reason why zoos should be banned is because animals in captivity suffer greatly. While some zoos may provide adequate care, many do not. Animals are often kept in small, sterile enclosures that bear no resemblance to their natural habitats. They have little room to move around, engage in natural behaviors, or socialize with members of their own species. They are forced to eat a diet that is not natural to them and subjected to unnatural light and sound conditions. These conditions can lead to physical and psychological stress, which can cause illnesses and shorten their lifespans.

Secondly, zoos promote the commodification of animals. In a zoo, animals are treated as objects of entertainment, rather than living beings with intrinsic value. They are often bred for the purpose of increasing the collection, rather than for conservation purposes. Animals are typically exhibited according to their popularity or cuteness, rather than by what is in their best interest. The breeding programs in zoos are primarily focused on keeping populations of captive animals at a high enough level to continue the collection of admission fees and merchandise sales.

Finally, zoos do not actually contribute much to conservation efforts. While it is true that some zoos have successful breeding programs, the animals that are born as a result of these programs are unlikely to be reintroduced to the wild. Zoos do have the ability to educate people about the importance of conservation, but this education can be accomplished through other means, such as documentaries and educational programs. Additionally, many zoos do not have the resources or expertise to provide adequate care for the animals in their care, let alone contribute to conservation efforts.

In conclusion, zoos may seem like a great way to learn about animals, conservation, and to spend a day out, but when we look deeper, we see that they have many shortcomings. Animals in captivity suffer greatly, zoos promote the commodification of animals, and they do not actually contribute much to conservation efforts. It is important to care for animals ethically. Therefore, it is time to move beyond zoos and find alternative ways to learn about and protect the animals on our planet. Zoos should be banned.",zoos should be banned,5.0,428.0,24.0,17.833333333333332,32.0,4.0,9.416666666666666,219.0,0.264018691588785,0.1471962616822429,0.0887850467289719,0.0373831775700934,0.0210280373831775,12.0,0.0594059405940594,5.25,0.4324324324324324,421.0,177.55606272667617,2.0,-0.0316577286523219,177.52440499802384,10.2,11.9,11.77,4.137805897559381,0.174,0.057,0.769,60.0,1.0,0.4698544698544699,20,10,2,1.0
"The relationship between economic development and the environment is complicated. While economic growth is essential to provide people with a better standard of living, it often comes at the cost of the environment. While some argue that we should prioritize economic development over environmental concerns, others believe that the environment should come first. In my opinion, we need to find a balance where economic development and the environment work together.

On the one hand, economic development is crucial to improving peopleâ€™s lives. The growth of industries and technology creates employment, increases income, and raises the standard of living. Economic development also provides the necessary funding for vital public services such as healthcare and education. It enables countries to invest in their infrastructure, such as transportation, energy, and communications, and expand opportunities for businesses to grow and expand.

On the other hand, the environment is critical to our survival. The air we breathe, the water we drink, and the soil that produces our food are all fundamental to our existence. Environmental degradation, such as deforestation, air, and water pollution, affects not only our health but also contributes to global warming, severe weather events, and other natural disasters. When we fail to take care of the environment, we put our own health and future at risk.

While many see economic development as antithetical to environmental conservation, it is possible to ensure that both growth and conservation occur simultaneously. For example, investing in renewable energy can create employment opportunities, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and improve energy security. Promoting sustainable agriculture and forestry practices can reduce land degradation and prevent deforestation. Encouraging recycling and waste reduction can help reduce pollution and encourage a circular economy.

In conclusion, economic development and environmental conservation have to go hand in hand. We cannot have one without the other. We must ensure that the growth of the economy does not come at the expense of the environment. While there are challenges to finding a balance between the economy and the environment, it is essential to address both and create a sustainable future that benefits people and the planet. We must strive to develop in such a way that economic growth enhances environmental sustainability.",economic development vs environment,5.0,365.0,21.0,17.38095238095238,31.0,7.0,8.619047619047619,202.0,0.2904109589041095,0.1616438356164383,0.1123287671232876,0.0383561643835616,0.021917808219178,8.0,0.043010752688172,5.381,0.4530120481927711,361.0,154.1267221682787,1.0,-0.0277886788454135,154.09893348943328,12.4,14.0,14.61,4.310072361705146,0.224,0.067,0.709,52.0,0.0,0.436144578313253,2,1,2,1.0
"Art is a vital aspect of human culture and history. From ancient cave paintings to modern-day installations, art reflects the diversity and creativity of our society. However, the arts are often overlooked when it comes to government funding. While the case for spending public money on the arts may not always be immediately obvious, I believe there are several compelling reasons why the government should invest in the arts.

First and foremost, the arts are an essential part of our cultural heritage. Art helps us to understand and appreciate the world around us, and it allows us to explore the experiences and emotions that make us human. Through art, we can better understand each other and learn about the world's history. Without support for the arts, so much of our cultural heritage would be lost, and future generations would not have access to the same rich tapestry of human experience.

Secondly, the arts are not just an important cultural heritage but also a significant contributor to the economy. The creative industries, which include a range of areas such as advertising, design, film, music, and publishing, are some of the fastest growing sectors globally. These industries provide jobs and help support local economies. Investing in the arts, such as public art projects, helps to create jobs and attract tourists, thus stimulating the local economy.

Thirdly, art can play a crucial role in education. It encourages creativity and self-expression while also developing essential skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving. Studies have shown that students who are exposed to arts education perform better in other academic areas, such as math and science. The government should allocate resources to support art education programs in schools and universities to ensure that individuals are not only receiving academic education but also developing their creativity.

Finally, investing in the arts can help to promote social cohesion, particularly in diverse communities. Art has the power to bring people together and bridge cultural divides. Public art projects designed with the cooperation of the local people help to develop a sense of community while also promoting the importance of their particular cultures.

In conclusion, artistic expression is a vital aspect of our society, and the government should support and invest in it. The arts are essential to our cultural heritage, contribute to the economy, aid education, and promote social cohesion. Government funding for the arts would not only benefit a significant sector but also uplift and enrich the lives of community members. It is crucial to recognize the value of art and provide financial support to ensure its survival, and this is something the government should consider as a priority.",Government should spend money on ARTs,6.0,441.0,23.0,19.17391304347826,31.0,9.0,9.347826086956522,238.0,0.2834467120181406,0.1541950113378684,0.1133786848072562,0.0317460317460317,0.0249433106575963,11.0,0.0478260869565217,5.478,0.4503042596348884,439.0,185.9879978182244,0.0,0.0,185.9879978182244,12.0,13.3,12.88,4.162964142075057,0.179,0.049,0.772,62.0,0.0,0.4361054766734279,2,1,2,1.0
"Keeping animals in zoos is a controversial topic with strong arguments both for and against. Some people argue that zoos are essential for conservation purposes and to educate the public about different species. Others suggest that animals should never be held captive and that zoos are cruel and inhumane. While both arguments have some merit, I believe that zoos should be held accountable for their treatment of animals and focus primarily on conservation and education.

One of the main arguments in favor of zoos is that they play a crucial role in conservation efforts. Zoos can provide a safe home for endangered and vulnerable species, assisting in their survival and promoting genetic diversity to prevent extinction. Some zoos collaborate with conservation organizations to help protect animals in the wild and improve their natural habitats. Zoos also educate the public on conservation issues, teaching visitors about the importance of protecting wildlife and preserving their natural habitats.

However, critics argue that keeping animals in a confined space is cruel and inhumane. Animals that are meant to roam free in the wild might be subjected to unsuitable conditions such as small enclosures, inadequate nutrition, and lack of mental stimulation. There have been plenty of instances of mistreatment and neglect in zoos, which puts the animals' health and welfare at risk.

Therefore, to address these concerns, zoos should monitor their captivity conditions, ensure that animals are well-fed, healthy, and safe from external threats. They should prioritize enrichment programs that provide animals with mental stimulation, activities that mimic natural behaviors and environments, and encourage physical activity.

Another way to improve the livelihood of animals in zoos is to prioritize conservation efforts. Zoos can put a greater emphasis on rehabilitation and reintroduction programs that enable animals to return to the wild. Such programs would help aid in wild population restoration, allowing other animals in the same species to thrive in an ecosystem and re-establish their natural habitats.

In conclusion, if zoos are to survive, they should operate ethically and focus primarily on conservation and education efforts. They must improve conditions by adhering to the highest standards of animal welfare, providing opportunities for enrichment and mental stimulation, and put greater efforts into rehab programs to restore species to their natural habitats. By taking these measures, we can uncover a future where zoos can coexist with animals while also increasing conservation efforts and raising public awareness of pressing environmental issues.",Keeping animals in zoos,6.0,402.0,19.0,21.157894736842103,34.0,14.0,9.578947368421051,212.0,0.3059701492537313,0.1865671641791045,0.1044776119402985,0.017412935323383,0.0298507462686567,12.0,0.054054054054054,6.316,0.4615384615384615,397.0,143.53740210446475,1.0,-0.0329184519939796,143.50448365247075,13.9,15.8,14.91,4.081986532428739,0.163,0.084,0.753,65.0,0.0,0.4117647058823529,6,3,2,1.0
"Artists are an essential part of any society, serving as a window into new perspectives, ideas, and cultures. As creators, it is their right to express their ideas freely through their art. However, there have been instances where artists' freedom of expression has been challenged. I believe that artists should have the freedom to express their ideas in all forms of art without censorship or oppression.

Art has played a substantial role in critical issues throughout history, including social, political, and environmental matters. From Pablo Picasso's Guernica, documenting the horrors of war to Banksyâ€™s thought-provoking street art, art has the power to communicate a message, instigate change, and spark a conversation. In an open society, artists must have the freedom to push the boundaries, address controversial topics, and challenge the status quo.

However, in some societies, governments, or individuals may find the content of the artist's work to be offensive or subversive, leading to censorship, persecution, or even imprisonment. Such censorship not only violates the artists' freedom of expression but also restricts society's ability to engage in discussions and debates on pressing issues.

It is imperative that we allow artists to express their ideas freely without fear of repercussion. Additionally, we must recognize and embrace the importance of artistic expression in promoting intellectual curiosity and furthering democratic values. Societies should create an environment that encourages and fosters creative expression and free speech, allowing for new ideas and critical voices to be heard and disseminated.

It is worth noting that freedom of expression is not without limitations. While artists must have the freedom to express themselves, like any human rights, it must go hand-in-hand with social responsibility. Art can evoke intense emotions and requires artists to be aware of potential consequences that may arise from their work. It is crucial for artists to understand how their work might affect the public and use their judgment and creativity to ensure that it neither harms others nor promotes hate speech.

In conclusion, the freedom of expression for artists should remain sacrosanct. It would be a travesty to prohibit artists from expressing their thoughts and ideas as it could significantly hinder creativity and societal growth. As such, we must ensure that artists have the right to express themselves freely and limit censorship in any form. The impact of artists throughout history and society at large makes protecting and promoting creative expression an essential component of any healthy and democratic society.",Artists' freedom to express ideas,6.0,406.0,20.0,20.3,31.0,11.0,9.95,228.0,0.2906403940886699,0.1724137931034483,0.0862068965517241,0.0369458128078817,0.0344827586206896,12.0,0.0560747663551401,6.65,0.4782608695652174,401.0,157.79783671425812,6.0,-0.5198148102840079,157.27802190397412,12.4,15.0,14.27,4.304055067292012,0.262,0.051,0.687,57.0,0.0,0.4326086956521739,8,4,2,1.0
"Advertising is an essential aspect of marketing, aimed at informing and persuading consumers to purchase goods or services. While some regard advertising as an essential component of our lives that promotes free markets and consumer choices, others consider it more negative, leading to societal pressure, psychological manipulation, and materialism. In my opinion, advertising has both positive and negative aspects and its impact on our lives depends on how it is designed and executed.

On the positive side, advertising can provide consumers with information about products and services that help them make sound purchasing decisions, leading to satisfaction and optimal consumption experiences. Effective advertising campaigns can motivate people to try new products, influence public opinion, and create brand loyalty. Advertising also plays a crucial role in many economies, driving competition, creating jobs, and generating tax revenues. The revenue from advertising can also fund the production of free or low-cost services such as music, television, and journalism.

However, critics of advertising argue that it has negative psychological effects on consumers, resulting in excessive materialism, addiction, and compulsive buying. It creates an artificial sense of need, leading to personal debt, poor impulse control, and negative self-image. Some advertising campaigns are specifically designed to manipulate emotions, often using images that exploit consumer insecurities such as body image, self-esteem, and social status. Additionally, much of modern advertising employs aggressive marketing techniques that intrude on our private lives, interrupting our television viewing experiences, and interrupting our time spent on the internet.

Therefore, it is crucial to strike a balance between the positive and negative aspects of advertising. Advertising should be designed and executed more responsibly, with a focus on informative, educational, and persuasive content that does not exploit consumers' emotional insecurities. The use of manipulative or misleading advertising should be frowned upon and discouraged through greater regulatory oversight. Advertising campaigns should respect the right to privacy, avoiding intrusive marketing while ensuring consumers can access necessary information for informed purchasing decisions.

In conclusion, advertising can have both positive and negative effects on our lives. While it is a crucial component in free-market economies, it needs to be balanced with responsibility and ethical standards. Advertising can be informative, persuasive, and have a beneficial impact on consumer choice and behavior, but it must be designed and executed responsibly. In addition, regulators and industry stakeholders should work together to ensure that advertising is done in a manner that respects consumers, upholds ethical standards, and avoids negative psychological consequences on society.",Advertising - positive or negative part of our lives,5.0,410.0,19.0,21.57894736842105,31.0,13.0,9.052631578947368,241.0,0.324390243902439,0.1634146341463414,0.1414634146341463,0.0219512195121951,0.0268292682926829,12.0,0.0495867768595041,6.474,0.4798301486199575,409.0,155.12704741304205,0.0,0.0,155.12704741304205,16.4,18.4,17.58,4.372795081315092,0.116,0.112,0.771,66.0,0.0,0.3651804670912951,0,0,1,1.0
"Nuclear power is a type of energy generation that is fueled by the process of nuclear fission or fusion of atomic nuclei. Despite being a clean and efficient source of energy, it has remained a controversial topic due to the risks of radioactive contamination. While some countries continue to invest in nuclear power, others opt for more traditional methods such as coal, oil, or renewable energy. In my opinion, nuclear power does provide clean and cheap energy, but its utilization must be balanced with safety, regulations, and ethical considerations.

Nuclear power is an advantageous source of energy for several reasons. First, it is a clean source of energy with low emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, making it a better option than fossil fuels such as oil, coal or gas. Additionally, nuclear power plants are efficient energy generators, producing more power per unit of fuel than any other type of energy generator. This makes it a valuable option for meeting energy needs in high-density areas.

Furthermore, nuclear power is relatively cheap compared to alternatives such as renewable energy. The cost of generating nuclear energy on a per-kWh basis is stable and predictable, making it easier for energy companies and consumers to calculate costs and manage energy supply. Furthermore, nuclear power plants do not require large amounts of fuel, reducing their overall operational costs.

However, one disadvantage of nuclear power is the potential risks associated with radioactive contamination. In case of a nuclear accident, radiation and nuclear waste can contaminate surrounding areas, resulting in severe health problems and environmental damages. The risks of nuclear waste disposal remain a significant concern, as the majority of the waste remains radioactive for centuries, making it a potential target for terrorist attacks.

Therefore, the utilization of nuclear power must proceed with caution, adhering to strict safety protocols and international regulations. While nuclear energy is clean and cheap, it poses a risk that cannot be ignored. Safety must always be a top priority and protocols put in place to minimize the risks. A comprehensive plan must be created to handle and dispose of nuclear waste. Regular maintenance, inspections and monitoring should be carried out to ensure that safety issues are addressed and dealt with quickly.

In conclusion, nuclear power is a source of energy that has its advantages and disadvantages. While it is a clean and efficient source of energy, its utilization must be balanced with safety, regulations, and ethical considerations. Nuclear technology has the potential to provide a reliable supply of energy to meet the demands of a growing population while reducing carbon emissions.

"In today's digital age, mobile phones have become essential tools for communication, job searching, and information sharing. For unemployed individuals, mobile phones can be particularly important, allowing them to stay in touch with potential employers and access job-listing websites and job portals. However, providing mobile phones to the unemployed is a controversial topic, with some believing that it is an unnecessary cost, while others argue it is a valuable investment. In my opinion, giving mobile phones to the unemployed is a good initiative and can positively impact their ability to find work.

One reason why mobile phones are valuable for unemployed people is the ability to access online job postings and apply for jobs remotely. Internet access is vital when searching for a job, and mobile phones provide the flexibility and convenience for users to connect to the internet and access job portals from anywhere. With a mobile phone, jobseekers can quickly and efficiently respond to job openings, schedule interviews, and conduct job research, boosting their chances of success.

Moreover, mobile phones can facilitate communication among jobseekers and potential employers. Jobseekers can receive notifications, alerts, and updates regarding their job applications, providing direct and timely communication with employers. The ability to communicate with employers enhances jobseekers' chances of securing employment, improving their quality of life.

Lastly, owning a mobile phone also improves the well-being of unemployed people. Mobile phones provide a sense of connection to the external world, allowing users to communicate with family, friends, and colleagues regardless of their location. They are also a source of information, providing access to news and current events, entertainment, and resources for mental health and wellbeing.

Overall, providing mobile phones to the unemployed is a valuable initiative. However, it is worth considering the cost of the initiative and how it will be implemented. The cost of smartphones and data plans can be substantial, especially in countries with a higher rate of unemployment. There should be a means of identifying those who would benefit from the initiative most, perhaps by targeting specific groups such as those living in remote areas or with disabilities that limit their mobility.

In conclusion, providing mobile phones to the unemployed can significantly improve their ability to search for jobs, access information, and communicate with potential employers, improving their overall quality of life. Governments or NGOs should explore this idea as an effective way to support jobseekers and help them succeed in the workforce.

"The price of petrol has always been a topic of debate because of its influence on the economy and the environment. Recent studies have shown a rise in petrol prices can have a positive impact on reducing traffic and pollution. In this essay, we will explore how petrol price increases can lead to a decrease in traffic and pollution and why it is crucial to impose such measures.

Firstly, a petrol price hike would encourage individuals to switch to more eco-friendly transport options such as, cycling or public transport. This switch would reduce the number of vehicles on the road leading to less traffic congestion. Furthermore, the change in behaviour from driving to cycling and walking would lead to a healthier and more active population, reducing the health risks associated with a sedentary lifestyle like obesity and heart diseases. It would also make the streets safer for all road users, especially cyclists and pedestrians, increasing their mobility.

Secondly, when petrol prices are increased, vehicle owners are discouraged from driving more kilometres than necessary. The high petrol prices would genuinely reflect the cost of using personal vehicles in terms of environmental and social externalities. If petrol prices are adequately designed, people would consider more seriously when using their car based on their needs and budget. This would lead to a reduction in pollution caused by vehicles, including vehicle emissions and noise pollution, which is known to have detrimental effects on health and the natural environment.

Thirdly, higher petrol prices could encourage car manufacturers to develop more fuel-efficient cars. Manufacturers strive to comply better with the Clean Air Act and create cars that are more energy-efficient, thereby decreasing the environmental footprint. Fuel-efficient cars could progressively lessen greenhouse emissions and help reduce the overall carbon footprint over the longterm.

In conclusion, the increase in petrol prices can indeed impact the reduction of traffic and pollution. Higher petrol prices would provide incentive to encourage individuals to change modes of transportation or only use their cars based on necessity. Additionally, it could give car manufacturers an additional impetus to develop more energy-efficient and eco-friendly cars as the benefits of investing in research and development grow. Hence, it is important for governments and citizens worldwide to maintain not just the current petrol prices but also gradually increase them since it would lead to environmental and social benefits.",Can petrol price increase impact on reducing traffic and pollution?,5.0,391.0,18.0,21.72222222222222,34.0,13.0,9.833333333333334,217.0,0.3171355498721228,0.1687979539641943,0.1048593350383631,0.0179028132992327,0.0409207161125319,11.0,0.05,6.444,0.4929577464788732,392.0,147.05242297711513,0.0,0.0,147.05242297711513,12.9,15.7,14.5,4.33527914490252,0.096,0.016,0.888,59.0,1.0,0.4154929577464789,0,0,1,1.0
"Living in a small town has long been a popular choice for those who prefer a quieter and less hectic lifestyle. Although cities have a lot to offer in terms of work, leisure and cultural activities, there are many compelling reasons why some people prefer the relaxed pace of life in a small town.

Firstly, a small town offers a sense of community that is often lacking in big cities. Walking around a small town, one can easily bump into a familiar face, and people tend to be friendlier towards one another. In general, small towns cultivate a more tight-knit community atmosphere, allowing people to build stronger relationships, trust and loyalty.

Secondly, small towns offer safety and security, providing citizens with a greater sense of peace. In contrast to cities, small towns are less prone to crime and violence. People who choose to live in small towns can let their guard down and not always be on high alert for danger or unexpected events.

Thirdly, small towns offer a healthier environment. With fewer crowded places, small towns do not experience the same smog and pollution that decorate cities. Living in a less polluted environment has a positive impact on both physical and mental health. The stress caused by life in the city, including the pressure to keep up with the hustle and bustle can lead to negative health effects. A peaceful community can help alleviate stress levels and promote a healthier lifestyle.

Lastly, living in small towns is usually less costly in terms of housing, taxes, food, and entertainment. One of the main drawbacks of living in the cities is the extremely high cost of living. Small towns generally offer a range of more affordable options and are less expensive to live in.

In conclusion, while cities are undoubtedly full of energy, bright lights, and endless opportunities, living in a small town can provide numerous advantages. Small towns offer a comfortable, friendly and family-oriented community, where people feel safe and secure. Small towns tend to offer a more affordable quality of life considerable with more space to live and reduced expenses. Ultimately, whether someone chooses to live in a small town or big city depends on a personâ€™s preference, lifestyle, and goals. It is important to weigh both the advantages and disadvantages of both settlements before making a final decision.",Prefer to live in a small town rather than a city,6.0,390.0,21.0,18.571428571428573,33.0,7.0,8.142857142857142,219.0,0.2717948717948718,0.1333333333333333,0.1589743589743589,0.0153846153846153,0.0128205128205128,13.0,0.0585585585585585,5.905,0.4795454545454545,387.0,155.4555506281933,0.0,0.0,155.4555506281933,9.4,11.6,11.2,4.344611263341698,0.177,0.071,0.752,56.0,0.0,0.3886363636363636,2,1,2,1.0
"The debate on which method of learning is better: knowledge from books or knowledge from experience has been going on for ages. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. However, the majority of people generally agree that knowledge from experience is more important than knowledge acquired from books. This essay will discuss why learning through experience is vital and how it supersedes bookish knowledge.

Firstly, knowledge from experience provides opportunities for people to develop a wide range of life skills. Interactions with other people, facing challenges, and overcoming difficulties in everyday life offer individuals a chance to learn skills that might not be directly taught in books. Learning through practice helps individuals to develop their problem solving abilities, decision-making skills and helps develop effective communication practices.

Secondly, experience is a more effective teaching tool than traditional classroom-style learning. By experiencing events themselves, students are more engaged in the learning process. As learners practice and experiment, they acquire more experience, which helps them solidify their understanding of concepts. Additionally, experiential learning provides a deeper appreciation of the subject matterâ€™s practical applications.

Thirdly, experience offers learners a more direct connection to the environment and real-life situations. Real-life situations are different from situations found in books. Experiences are contextual in that individuals get to feel and see the real situation and its impacts. They find value in instances that are unique to their experiences. Learners that experience information unravel themselves from biased or incomplete information provided by others. They also directly understand the curricular relevance with the world outside.

In conclusion, while book knowledge is necessary in many ways, learning from experience is more important. Knowledge acquired through experience provides learners with a broader range of skills and a deeper understanding of the subject matter. Learning by experiencing encourages learners to experiment, take risks, question routine, and probe deeper to ensure the knowledge they receive is straight from the horseâ€™s mouth. There is no substitute for experiential learning when it comes to preparing people to solve the challenges of daily real-life problems.",Knowledge from experience is more important than that from books,5.0,338.0,21.0,16.095238095238095,27.0,6.0,7.0,194.0,0.3224852071005917,0.1568047337278106,0.1065088757396449,0.029585798816568,0.0059171597633136,10.0,0.0505050505050505,5.714,0.4947368421052631,340.0,134.5539560809705,0.0,0.0,134.5539560809705,13.1,15.2,16.88,3.965204570682366,0.157,0.045,0.798,46.0,3.0,0.3868421052631579,2,1,2,1.0
"The growing urbanisation has led to increased traffic congestions and housing problems. The solution to this problem is a matter of great concern. Some suggest that moving companies to the rural areas is the answer to the traffic and housing problems. Though there are advantages to such a move, there are also many challenges to consider. This essay will discuss the pros and cons of moving companies to the rural areas to solve the traffic and housing problems.

On the one hand, one of the major advantages of moving companies to rural areas is that it will help in reducing traffic congestion. By relocating companies to less populated areas would motivate the employees to move with their work thereby reducing daily commuting time, lowering carbon emissions and improving air quality. Likewise, moving companies into less populated areas would result in lower house prices and, hence, more affordable housing. Also, with sufficient housing and schools cheaper than in urban areas, companies in rural areas could attract more highly skilled professionals.

On the other hand, significant challenges and drawbacks to moving companies to the rural areas exist. First and foremost, moving a company to a rural area might be a danger of losing access to essential services such as quality healthcare and reliable broadband. Secondly, companies in rural areas would have a more limited talent pool to draw from. It may leave a gap for positions in which expertise is not readily available. Additionally, Moving a business may result in significant financial costs that some companies may not be willing to bear. The cost of setting up new infrastructures in rural areas may be a huge challenge. Therefore, companies intending to relocate will have to ensure they have done proper research before making a decision.

In conclusion, moving companies to the rural areas can help alleviate traffic and housing problems substantially. It could also create more jobs for local people living in the rural communities and boost the population in the countryside. Nevertheless, it has a few disadvantages such as lack of access to essential services and higher relocation costs. Companies must consider these advantages and disadvantages before making any decision about relocation. Therefore, it is imperative to weigh the pros and cons before making such a decision, that will have a massive impact on a company's success in the future.",Solve traffic and housing problems by moving companies to the rural areas?,4.0,389.0,21.0,18.52380952380953,28.0,11.0,9.095238095238097,203.0,0.2853470437017995,0.1619537275064267,0.1105398457583547,0.0205655526992287,0.0411311053984575,11.0,0.0552763819095477,6.19,0.4532710280373832,385.0,158.00367282563403,1.0,-0.0738046511219552,157.92986817451208,11.7,12.5,12.53,4.296433990984285,0.148,0.08,0.771,50.0,1.0,0.4462616822429907,10,3,4,1.0
"Air pollution is the presence of harmful substances in the air that we breathe. It is a major environmental issue that is affecting people all around the world. Air pollutants can come from both natural and human-made sources, such as car emissions, industrial factories, and burning fossil fuels.

Air pollution has a number of adverse effects on the environment and human health. One of the most prominent effects is the degradation of air quality, which leads to a range of respiratory problems such as asthma, bronchitis, and lung cancer. It can also cause heart disease, stroke, and other serious health problems. In addition, air pollution can damage ecosystems, reduce crop yields, and harm wildlife.

The main contributors to air pollution are transportation, industry, and power generation. Cars and trucks are one of the biggest emitters of pollutants such as carbon monoxide and particulate matter. Industrial factories release large amounts of harmful chemicals and toxins into the air, including sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. Power plants that run on fossil fuels like coal and oil also emit harmful gases and particulate matter.

To combat air pollution, various measures and policies have been implemented around the world. These include reducing fossil fuel use, promoting alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power, improving public transportation, and enforcing stricter emissions standards for vehicles and factories. Governments and organizations also encourage individuals to adopt eco-friendly practices such as carpooling, cycling, and using energy-efficient appliances.

In conclusion, air pollution is a global problem that requires immediate action to protect the environment and human health. Individuals and governments must work together to reduce emissions and implement sustainable solutions to combat this issue. By taking steps to reduce air pollution, we can create a healthier and cleaner world for future generations.",Air pollution,5.0,295.0,17.0,17.352941176470587,28.0,12.0,6.882352941176471,190.0,0.4067796610169492,0.1254237288135593,0.1288135593220339,0.0135593220338983,0.0169491525423728,8.0,0.0441988950276243,6.235,0.5389221556886228,292.0,113.2250370972677,1.0,-0.0161771668286938,113.208859930439,12.4,14.0,14.5,4.371474114501233,0.097,0.095,0.808,42.0,0.0,0.3502994011976048,2,1,2,1.0
"Advertisements play a significant role in the marketing and sale of consumer goods. They are designed to create awareness about a product and persuade potential customers to purchase it. Advertisements can have both positive and negative effects on consumer goods, depending on their characteristics, target audience, and the strategy of the advertisers.

On the positive side, advertisements can help to increase consumer awareness of a product and its features. They can also build brand recognition and loyalty, particularly when products are advertised consistently and memorably. Effective advertising can also highlight the unique features and benefits of a product and create a sense of urgency to buy, leading to increased sales.

However, advertisements can also have negative effects on consumer goods. One of the most prominent issues is that advertisements can create unrealistic expectations, leading to disappointment when the product does not meet the customerâ€™s expectations. For example, a beauty product advertisement may show the model with clear, blemish-free skin, leading viewers to believe that the product will work for them in the same way. This can result in decreased customer loyalty and confidence in the brand.

Another negative effect of advertisements is that they can create a culture of materialism and consumerism. Advertisements can promote a culture of buying new products even when the older ones are still perfectly functional. This creates a demand for new products, which results in the production of more goods, increasing waste and pollution and creating unsustainable consumption.

Advertisers must take responsibility for the impact their advertisements have on consumer goods. They should create advertisements that are truthful, use realistic images, and present accurate information that represents the productâ€™s features and benefits. Advertisements should also be targeted to the right audience to avoid giving false hopes to customers, ultimately disappointing them leading to distrust in the brand.

In conclusion, advertisements are a powerful tool in the marketing and sale of consumer goods. They can positively influence sales by creating brand recognition, increasing awareness, and highlighting the unique features and benefits of a product. However, the negative effects of advertisements cannot be overlooked, such as creating false hopes, unattainable expectations and unhealthy consumption patterns.

"There is an ongoing debate regarding whether young people should go to university or not. While some argue that higher education is essential for a successful career and personal development, others believe that university is not necessary for all and that alternative paths such as vocational training or entrepreneurship can be just as advantageous.

Proponents of university education argue that it provides students with the opportunity to acquire knowledge and skills that are relevant to their chosen fields. A university degree can also increase a person's credibility and improve their job prospects, as many employers view higher education as a sign of commitment, dedication, and expertise. Furthermore, university can be a transformative experience where young people can be exposed to diverse perspectives and cultivate critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

On the other hand, critics of university education argue that it can be expensive and may not provide a guaranteed career success. With the cost of tuition rising every year and student loans being a significant burden, many question if university is worth the investment. Additionally, practical skills such as teamwork, communication and leadership abilities could be learnt through work experience and internships, which are absent in a university setting.

Others argue that in today's fast-paced, technology-driven society, vocational training or entrepreneurship may be more relevant than a university degree. Technical training can provide young people with the skills in demand from today's job market. Furthermore, entrepreneurship, particularly in some business-oriented fields, can provide immense potential for growth and financial freedom.

In conclusion, the decision to attend university depends on individual circumstances and preferences. While university education can provide numerous benefits such as knowledge, credibility, and personal development, it can come with a high cost. Ultimately, young people should weigh the pros and cons of attending a university and examine alternative paths to gain relevant skills and expertise.

"Mobile phones are ubiquitous devices that have significantly impacted the way we communicate with one another. The effects of mobile phones are both positive and negative and have far-reaching consequences on our personal and professional lives.

One of the positive effects of mobile phones is that it's easier to stay in touch with people who are geographically distant. With the widespread availability of mobile phones, people can communicate with friends and family regardless of location, building closer connections. Mobile phones also enable people to reach emergency services during times of crisis.

On the flip side, the negative effects of mobile phones lie in the fact that they can become a source of addiction, leading to behavioral issues. Social media, messaging apps, and other digital applications can trigger phone addiction, which can have negative impacts on productivity and health. Users can become disconnected from the real world, and their quality of life suffers.

Another negative consequence of mobile phones is the effect on driving. Texting or making calls while driving is responsible for numerous road accidents. The resulting deaths and injuries are a tragic outcome of mobile phone usage. The onset of ""text neck"" has also emerged, where users develop persistent neck pain due to holding their phones for extended periods.

Mobile phones can also have an impact on mental health. People who overuse their phones can become anxious, experience depression and other mental health disorders. The availability of information and platforms on which to compare one's life with others' has led to increases in social comparison and psychological distress.

In conclusion, mobile phones are incredibly useful and have made our lives easier in several ways. Still, they also have negative effects that should not be ignored. We must learn to use them judiciously and strike the right balance between the benefits and negative consequences of phone usage. It's necessary to ensure that mobile phone usage does not negatively impact our health, productivity, relationships, and other aspects of our lives.",Effects of mobile phones,6.0,329.0,19.0,17.31578947368421,26.0,10.0,8.210526315789474,189.0,0.2978723404255319,0.1246200607902735,0.1519756838905775,0.0303951367781155,0.0273556231003039,11.0,0.0621468926553672,5.737,0.5040650406504065,327.0,137.19765480768473,0.0,0.0,137.19765480768473,11.2,12.9,13.4,4.1458164701757685,0.078,0.134,0.788,44.0,0.0,0.4227642276422764,0,0,1,1.0
"There is a constant debate about whether students should be taught to compete or to cooperate. The answer to this question is not clear-cut, as it depends on several factors such as the teacher's style, the nature of the subject, the school culture, and the desired outcomes for students.

On the one hand, teaching students to compete can help improve their performance and motivate them to strive for excellence. Competition highlights each student's strengths and weaknesses, spurring them to work harder and push themselves to improve. Additionally, competition in sports or academic activities can be fun and promote a sense of school spirit and pride.

On the other hand, teaching students to cooperate can foster an atmosphere of teamwork, trust, and respect, encouraging learners to work together to achieve a common goal. Collaboration helps to build relationships and improve social skills, which are essential in the real world. In a cooperative classroom, students learn to listen actively, communicate effectively, share resources and pursue group goals, that help to grow their intellectual and emotional abilities.

Proponents of competition argue that it creates a healthy level of stress that can motivate students to achieve their goals. However, excessive competition can be detrimental to students' mental health and can lead to a toxic school culture where students value winning over healthy relationships. Moreover, competition can foster hostility and mistrust among students and lead to a personal rivalry that does not benefit anyone.

Adherents to cooperation contend that it builds teamwork skills, which are valuable in both academic and work settings, improving relationships, and enhance innovative thinking. Though cooperation comes with certain downsides, such as the possibility of freeriding. Group projects in which one person does the work for everyone can hinder productivity and foster a culture of laziness. 

In conclusion, students should not be taught to compete or to cooperate in isolation. A balance should be struck between the two approaches to ensure that students learn the skills that they require in the real world. Educators are thus called upon to combine both approaches to promote student development. By understanding the value of both competition and cooperation, students can learn to navigate the complex situations that they will face in their future lives.",Should students be taught to compete or to cooperate?,6.0,370.0,18.0,20.55555555555556,33.0,12.0,9.88888888888889,206.0,0.2729729729729729,0.2081081081081081,0.0783783783783783,0.0297297297297297,0.0351351351351351,12.0,0.0615384615384615,6.056,0.4771084337349398,365.0,150.6257412161698,2.0,-0.1124918686717765,150.51324934749803,12.5,14.8,14.04,4.303703658068783,0.238,0.042,0.72,51.0,0.0,0.4289156626506024,6,3,2,1.0
"Migration is the act of people moving from one location to another in search of better opportunities or a better quality of life. In recent years, more people than ever before are moving to other countries in search of a better life. There are several reasons why this is happening, and the effects of this trend on both host and source countries are significant.

One of the main reasons behind this trend is better economic opportunities. Developing countries often have limited job opportunities, and low wages, leading many to look for work in other countries. Host countries are in need of foreign labour to address skills shortages in various sectors, the inflow of labour helps to drive economies and increase the GDP of the host country.

Another reason why more people are migrating to other countries is social and political instability. People are forced to flee their home country due to war, conflict, natural disasters, or other threats. Host countries provide sanctuary to these people, and often treat them as refugees through U.N. established Refugee Programs. 

As people continue to migrate to other countries, there are several effects felt by both host and source countries. In host countries, migration can lead to an increase in cultural diversity, which ought to provide different outlooks towards various societal issues. Alongside an influx of labour can bring new perspectives to education as people bring their intellectual diversities with them.

Migration can also bring economic benefits to host countries such as new markets and trade partnerships, tapped labour resources, increased investment, and higher GDP. However, it may impact income inequalities, as some groups or regions may be more affected than others by the influx of workers leading to tensions.

In source countries, the loss of valuable human resources, particularly of skilled labour can lead to economic decay and hinder development, especially in sectors such as healthcare. Moreover, if young people continue to migrate in search of better opportunities, economic progress in their home country will significantly slow down.

In conclusion, there are several reasons why more people are migrating to other countries than ever before. While it is a complex issue that brings about many socioeconomic and geopolitical ramifications, it is clear that migration has far-reaching effects on both host and source countries.

"International tourism is now more common than ever before

In recent decades, international tourism has become increasingly widespread. This trend can be attributed to a variety of factors, including improved transportation capabilities, rising standards of living, and the desire for cultural exchange and adventure. This essay will explore the reasons behind the growing popularity of international tourism and discuss its implications for individuals and societies.

First and foremost, advancements in transportation have made it easier for people to travel internationally. With the advent of airplanes, high-speed trains, and cruise ships, individuals can now reach their desired destinations quickly and conveniently. Moreover, the decrease in travel costs has also contributed to the surge in international tourism. Reasonably priced flights, affordable accommodations, and discounted vacation packages offer greater accessibility for individuals of varying economic backgrounds, thus encouraging more people to embark on international trips.

Secondly, the rising standards of living around the world have fueled the growth of international tourism. As more countries experience economic development, the middle class has expanded, resulting in increased disposable income for individuals. Consequently, more people are able to afford international travel as a form of leisure, allowing them to explore foreign landscapes, experience different cultures, and broaden their horizons.

Additionally, international tourism has become more popular due to the desire for cultural exchange and adventure. In an interconnected world, individuals seek opportunities to immerse themselves in diverse societies, traditions, and lifestyles. Through international tourism, people can gain a deeper understanding of other cultures, foster global friendships, and challenge their own perspectives. Furthermore, many individuals are driven by the desire for adventure and exploration, seeking to discover new destinations and engage in thrilling activities.

The upsurge in international tourism has brought about numerous implications for individuals and societies. On an individual level, travel can provide a sense of fulfillment, personal growth, and lifelong memories. It allows individuals to step out of their comfort zones, learn about different customs, and develop a global mindset. Moreover, international tourism can have positive economic impacts on host countries, boosting local businesses, creating job opportunities, and stimulating economic growth. It also promotes cross-cultural understanding, tolerance, and peace, as people from diverse backgrounds interact and learn from one another's perspectives.

However, international tourism is not without its challenges. Mass tourism can strain local infrastructures, putting pressure on resources, transportation systems, and historical sites. It can lead to overcrowding and environmental degradation, potentially threatening the very attractions that draw tourists. Therefore, it is crucial for governments and tourism authorities to implement sustainable tourism practices, promote responsible travel, and preserve natural and cultural heritage sites for future generations.

In conclusion, international tourism has witnessed a significant surge in recent years, thanks to improved transportation, rising standards of living, and the human desire for cultural exchange and adventure. The growth of international tourism brings benefits such as personal fulfillment, economic development, and cultural understanding. However, it is essential to manage and mitigate the negative impacts of mass tourism to ensure its sustainability and preserve the beauty of tourist destinations.","write an ielts International tourism is now more common than ever before (for) without titles, heading of each paragraphs and numbers",8.0,503.0,26.0,19.346153846153847,29.0,8.0,7.730769230769231,282.0,0.3161033797216699,0.1550695825049702,0.1550695825049702,0.0159045725646123,0.0159045725646123,16.0,0.0524590163934426,5.63,0.4564102564102564,498.0,186.24651917,0.0,0.0,186.24651917,15.5,18.5,19.03,4.687445871293203,0.217,0.024,0.759,77.0,1.0,0.3435897435897436,16,7,3,1.0
"International tourism is a growing industry with an enormous impact on the world's economy. While some may argue that it is an excellent way for people to explore other countries and cultures, international tourism can also have several negative effects that must be considered.

One of the most significant negative effects of international tourism is the ecological disruption. Travel and related activities, including transportation, create an enormous amount of carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to climate change. The increase in tourist activities in natural areas results in the destruction of habitats, erosion of soil, and pollution of water sources. Popular attraction sites face overuse, leading to damage to natural resources and wildlife. This pressure may lead to government restrictions on destinations and activities, ultimately deterring tourists from visiting.

The influx of tourists also sometimes leads to the cultural degradation of local populations. The host cultures are eroded as tourists' preferences, and behavior encourages locals to take up cultural practices to meet the tourist's tastes, which can lead to the loss of their unique cultural practices. Further, tourists tend to consume markets and corner shops dedicated to selling traditional goods whose consumption may be for charm, particularly souvenir shops that sell mass-produced items resulting in diminished economic gain of local artisans. 

Moreover, international tourism does not benefit everyone in host countries equally. It tends to concentrate economic gains in a few areas and people, particularly large hotel chains and foreign corporations. The local people, mostly those in rural or remote areas, do not benefit as much as those in developed urban areas. Tourism can create seasonal and short-term employment that becomes unreliable and results in financial instability when economic performance becomes unpredictable.

In conclusion, international tourism does have its advantages, but its negative effects should not be ignored. The success of the industry demands planners, policymakers, and tourists alike to take accountability of the effects of international tourism. The need to respect cultures, the environment on which it occurs, and locals is crucial for continued ecotourism and sustainable growth. In the end, we need a better approach to transforming tourism as a sustainable economic activity that balances the interests of tourists, host communities and environmental conservation.",International tourism is now more common than ever before (against),5.0,365.0,18.0,20.27777777777778,35.0,11.0,8.944444444444445,219.0,0.3260273972602739,0.136986301369863,0.136986301369863,0.0136986301369863,0.021917808219178,7.0,0.0336538461538461,7.056,0.5207823960880196,364.0,141.55362917395055,0.0,0.0,141.55362917395055,13.6,16.3,15.95,4.464187239536683,0.124,0.066,0.81,47.0,0.0,0.393643031784841,0,0,1,1.0
"Living and studying overseas can be an exciting and life-changing experience for individuals. It provides the opportunity to experience different cultures, ways of living and improve communication skills while taking up new challenges. Living and studying overseas entail the need to adjust to new surroundings and cope with the challenges that come with familiarity, especially the social culture shock, language barriers, and academic adjustments.

One of the most significant benefits of studying overseas is the opportunity to experience different cultures. By living and studying abroad, students have the chance to meet people from all over the world and learn various ethnic ways of life. Students get to understand the world from a different perspective, relate to diverse cultures and ideas. Experiencing diversity in culture and setting can be enlightening and phenomenally improves self-awareness and confidence.

Another advantage of studying overseas is the chance to refine one's language skills. Studying in a foreign country provides an avenue to experience new languages and practise speaking and writing, further improving career prospects in foreign languages. It also provides an excellent opportunity for language immersion in everyday life and academic settings.

Additionally, studying overseas instils adaptability, problem-solving and independence among individuals. Immersing oneself in new and unfamiliar cultures requires a considerable degree of courage, creativity and discipline. Students who adapt to these challenges become self-reliant, confident and adaptable to new environments.

Nevertheless, living and studying overseas can be stressful and frustrating. It is not always easy to adjust to new cultural practices or social protocols from one's background. Particularly, a language barrier can contribute significantly to frustration and anxiety, leading to a sense of detachment and homesickness in some cases. 

In conclusion, studying and living overseas is a life-transforming opportunity that provides an avenue for personal and academic growth. With new languages, cultures and the networking opportunities that arise with studying abroad, students become open-minded and more confident. Nevertheless, studying overseas comes with its unique set of challenges that require perseverance, courage, and an open mind. Seeking support, forming bonds with fellow students and locals, and indulging oneself in new and exciting things, can facilitate a smooth transition to living and studying overseas.",Living and studying overseas,6.0,359.0,20.0,17.95,31.0,10.0,7.4,190.0,0.2785515320334262,0.1838440111420612,0.1225626740947075,0.022284122562674,0.0139275766016713,11.0,0.0502283105022831,5.85,0.4554455445544554,359.0,136.85580758930385,2.0,-0.0555272246241493,136.8002803646797,12.7,16.1,16.76,4.098499892499084,0.189,0.05,0.761,59.0,0.0,0.3663366336633663,10,5,2,1.0
"Exercise is an essential aspect of maintaining a healthy and balanced lifestyle. Regular and consistent exercise has physical and mental benefits. Incorporating daily exercise into your routine can help you have a more fulfilling and happier life.

Firstly, exercise promotes physical health by helping to reduce the risks of developing chronic diseases. Regular physical activity strengthens bones and muscles, reducing the risk of developing osteoporosis and improving balance, reducing the risk of falls and injuries. Exercise also helps to improve heart health by reducing the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack and high blood pressure. These health benefits can lead to a longer life expectancy and enable individuals to remain more active as they age, improving their quality of life.

Secondly, Exercise has significant mental health benefits. Studies have shown that exercising can help reduce stress, anxiety and depression. Physical activity stimulates the release of hormones such as endorphins that improve mood, combat feelings of stress and anxiety and promote relaxation. By improving mental health, exercise can lead to a better quality of life and provide a positive outlook towards life.

"Newspapers have been a trusted source of information and a part of our daily routine for centuries. However, with the advent of technology, the way we consume news has drastically changed. The rise of digital media and increased accessibility through smartphones and social media has sparked a debate on whether newspapers will become a thing of the past.

There are several arguments that support the view that newspapers will become obsolete. Firstly, the younger generation, who are digital natives, prefer to consume news through online platforms rather than printed newspapers. The ease of accessibility and convenience of digital media is a significant factor that contributes to the shift. Secondly, print newspapers incur more costs in terms of production and delivery, leading to a decline in circulation and revenue. Print media also faces the challenge of outdated news, as it takes longer to print and distribute than digital media. Lastly, the amount of paper waste generated from printing newspapers is significant, contributing to environmental concerns.

On the other hand, some argue that newspapers will not become a thing of the past. Firstly, print newspapers are still a reliable source of information and have a loyal readership. Many people still prefer the tactile experience of reading a newspaper, which cannot be replicated with digital media. Secondly, newspapers provide a comprehensive overview of news, covering a range of topics in depth, which is not always possible with digital media's limited attention span. Lastly, newspapers also have a significant historical value as a record of events, culture, and society, which cannot be replaced by digital media.

In conclusion, while the shift towards digital media cannot be ignored, the future of newspapers cannot be predicted with certainty. Print newspapers still have a place in society, but they need to adapt to the changing landscape by innovating and embracing technology. It is possible that we may see a hybrid of print and digital media, where newspapers offer both physical copies and digital versions to cater to changing reader preferences. The only certainty is that the way we consume news will continue to evolve, and newspapers will need to adapt to remain relevant.",Will newspapers become a thing of the past?,4.0,356.0,18.0,19.77777777777778,29.0,13.0,9.88888888888889,189.0,0.2949438202247191,0.1573033707865168,0.098314606741573,0.0224719101123595,0.0280898876404494,13.0,0.0710382513661202,5.944,0.452970297029703,357.0,140.18119012623072,0.0,0.0,140.18119012623072,12.2,13.7,13.11,4.148781195916731,0.072,0.024,0.904,43.0,0.0,0.4405940594059406,6,3,2,1.0
"Technology has undoubtedly changed the way we live our lives in countless ways, from facilitating faster communication to improving healthcare and transportation systems. However, there is a common belief that technology can solve all of our problems, such as social inequality, environmental degradation, and poverty. This is a flawed perspective. Technology is a tool that can create opportunities and provide solutions, but it cannot fix all the world's problems.

One reason technology cannot solve all the world's problems is that it can cause new issues. For example, social media, while a powerful tool for communication, has been linked to a rise in cyberbullying, mental health issues, and the spread of misinformation. Similarly, advancements in agriculture technologies, such as genetically modified crops, have been under fire for their potential impact on biodiversity and ecological systems.

Another reason is that technology is limited by access and infrastructure. Many parts of the world lack the necessary infrastructure for technology to function appropriately. In many developing nations, access to clean water, electricity, and basic healthcare is still a challenge. In these areas, basic needs like healthcare, food, and shelter, not technological advancements, need to be addressed to create a fair and just society.

Furthermore, technology is only as great as the human who wields it. Many issues that require fixed solutions are entrenched in complex social and political problems. Technological solutions alone are unable to change deep-seated beliefs, behaviors, and attitudes towards these issues. Issues such as poverty, inequality and intolerance need systemic and structural alterations to overcome.

Finally, relying solely on technology can exacerbate the issues of inequality. Technological advancements favor specific groups and exacerbate the gap between the developed and undeveloped world. There is already a divide between those with adequate access to technology and those without, further accentuating social inequality between nations and within societies.

In conclusion, while technology provides a platform to create solutions to societal challenges, it is not a panacea for all the world's problems. Technological advancements should be carefully scrutinized and applied for maximum impact. We should continue to explore technological innovations, but we must ensure that they consider social, political, and environmental factors, and are accompanied by holistic solutions to address the issues of today's society. Combining technology with efforts to tackle poverty, inequality, environmental degradation, and other humanitarian challenges can lead to better outcomes, and a more prosperous, sustainable, and equitable society.",Technology cannot solve all the world's problems,6.0,397.0,22.0,18.045454545454547,32.0,5.0,8.454545454545455,231.0,0.2921914357682619,0.1410579345088161,0.1335012594458438,0.0277078085642317,0.0251889168765743,9.0,0.0412844036697247,5.636,0.4580645161290322,397.0,162.67278322431838,1.0,-0.0145726815121055,162.65821054280627,13.9,15.8,16.18,4.276848402836213,0.145,0.104,0.751,61.0,0.0,0.4,3,1,3,1.0
"Cannabis, also known as marijuana, has been a controversial topic for decades. In recent years, several states and countries have legalized the use of cannabis for medical and recreational purposes. However, there is still a lot of misinformation and misconceptions surrounding this plant. Here are some facts about cannabis that everyone should know.

Firstly, cannabis contains several chemical compounds, the most well-known being tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is the psychoactive compound that causes a â€˜high,â€™ while CBD is non-psychoactive and is used for medical purposes. Cannabis strains are often classified as indica, sativa, or hybrid, depending on their chemical composition.

Secondly, cannabis has medicinal properties that have been known for centuries. It has been used to manage symptoms of conditions like chronic pain, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and anxiety disorders. Cannabis can also help with nausea and appetite stimulation for those undergoing chemotherapy, resulting in better quality of life.

Thirdly, legalized cannabis can generate tax revenue and create job opportunities. In countries where cannabis has been legalized, the cannabis industry has created thousands of jobs, and the tax revenue generated has been significant. Legalization also reduces the number of individuals facing arrest and incarceration for small, nonviolent drug offenses.

However, cannabis does have negative effects. Smoking cannabis can cause respiratory problems, and it can be addictive. While research suggests that cannabis is less addictive than tobacco or alcohol, it can still lead to dependence, especially for those who begin consuming it at a young age. Additionally, the potential for misuse and abuse of cannabis by teens should be carefully monitored.

Furthermore, not all cannabis products are created equal. THC from illicit sources can contain dangerous additives and contaminants that pose health risks. It is essential to obtain cannabis from reliable sources and after checking if the product has gone through all quality checks and standards to ensure the safety of the consumer.

In conclusion, cannabis can be both beneficial and harmful, and the context of use would determine its effects. While it has medicinal value and can generate income for states and countries, there are risks and concerns surrounding its use. Proper regulation, adequate research, and access to accurate information can help in making informed decisions surrounding cannabis use. Like any other substance, moderation and responsible use are the keys to using cannabis with minimal risks and maximizing its benefits.",The Truth About Cannabis,7.0,391.0,24.0,16.291666666666668,30.0,6.0,7.416666666666667,235.0,0.3120204603580562,0.1483375959079284,0.0997442455242966,0.0255754475703324,0.0306905370843989,16.0,0.0744186046511627,5.25,0.5132743362831859,377.0,140.4234002535767,9.0,-0.536725606603376,139.8866746469733,10.8,13.9,14.96,4.4353590635865485,0.102,0.083,0.815,65.0,2.0,0.3938053097345133,0,0,1,1.0
"Same-sex marriage has been a controversial topic for decades. Same-sex marriage refers to the union of two people of the same sex, and there have been debates about whether or not this practice should be recognized and legal. However, in today's society, same-sex marriage should be seen as a non-issue.

Firstly, same-sex relationships exist, and people have the right to choose to be with whomever they wish. An individual's sexuality is a personal matter, and society should not dictate who they should love and marry. It is a matter of individual freedom and choice, and denying two consenting adults the right to get married because of their sexual orientation is an infringement on their fundamental human rights.

Secondly, same-sex marriage does not threaten traditional marriage or family values. Traditional family values are about love, care, and commitment, which exist regardless of the gender of the partners in a relationship. There is no difference in the love and commitment that same-sex couples share than that of different-sex couples.

Thirdly, allowing same-sex marriage does not harm society or undermine the institution of marriage. In fact, legalizing same-sex marriage can benefit society through increased social and economic stability. When same-sex couples are allowed to marry, it strengthens their relationships by providing legal recognition and protection. It also provides same-sex couples with the same legal rights and benefits as different-sex couples, which helps reduce the social and economic disparities created by unequal treatment.

Moreover, preventing same-sex couples from marrying is discriminatory and can lead to mental health issues for those affected by it. It causes unnecessary stress and trauma for same-sex couples and their families who may not have the same legal rights and protections as different-sex couples. This creates a feeling of social exclusion and can negatively impact individual well-being, and the damage to society at large.

In conclusion, the non-issue of same-sex marriage should be resolved by providing the same legal and social awards to same-sex couples. All individuals should have the freedom to choose whom they love and wish to marry. Denying same-sex marriage is discriminatory, infringes on individual freedom, and causes unnecessary stress and traumas for those affected. Acceptance and understanding should be encouraged in society, and the legal and social rights of individuals should be protected, irrespective of their sexual orientation, as everyone deserves respect, dignity, and human rights.",The Non-Issue of Same Sex Marriage,6.0,390.0,20.0,19.5,32.0,9.0,10.25,198.0,0.2974358974358974,0.1564102564102564,0.1487179487179487,0.0384615384615384,0.0307692307692307,19.0,0.0913461538461538,5.85,0.4141876430205949,406.0,168.65176470914045,1.0,-0.0611652355050049,168.59059947363545,13.3,14.8,14.33,3.839772506256937,0.223,0.08,0.697,62.0,1.0,0.4691075514874142,6,3,2,1.0
"Camping is an outdoor activity that provides an opportunity to escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life, to connect with nature, and to create memories with loved ones. Everyone should go camping at least once in their lifetime.

Camping allows individuals to appreciate the natural environment, breathe fresh air, and take in the peaceful surroundings.

Secondly, camping is highly beneficial for physical and mental health. Camping provides an opportunity to participate in physical activities such as hiking, swimming, or fishing, which helps improve physical fitness and well-being. The fresh air, sunlight, and immersion in nature are also excellent for mental health and can have a positive impact on mood, happiness, and overall well-being.

Thirdly, camping is a social activity that encourages bonding and creating memories with loved ones.

"Locker checks by school security officials, teachers, or administrators have become increasingly common in schools throughout the world. The purpose of these checks is to ensure the safety and security of students by deterring the presence and use of illegal substances or hazardous materials. However, there has been an ongoing debate about the usefulness and legality of locker checks. 

The supporters of locker checks argue that it creates a safe and secure learning environment for students and staff. By conducting locker checks, school officials can prevent students from bringing drugs, weapons, or other harmful items into school. It also encourages students to be more mindful and conscious of the contents of their lockers and the impact of their actions on the school community at large. In addition, locker checks can deter students from engaging in harmful activities on school grounds.

On the other side of the debate, opponents argue that locker checks are an invasion of privacy and violate students' rights. Students should have the same privacy protection in their lockers as they would have in their homes or other personal spaces. Locker checks can also lead to a violation of trust between students and school authorities, which can create an atmosphere of distrust and hostility at school. 

Moreover, locker checks may not be effective in preventing dangerous items or activities in schools. Students could still possess or engage in harmful activities outside of school and be unaffected by locker checks. This lack of effectiveness means that the checks may only serve as a form of intimidation towards the students and not have any tangible impact on the school.

In conclusion, while locker checks can provide a sense of security and safety for school communities, their legality and effectiveness are both questionable. Students do have rights to privacy and can feel violated by such checks. While it is important to prioritize the safety of the students, alternative measures like educating and counseling the students on the ill-effects of drugs and weapons might be a better way to approach the issue and curb the undesired behavior. It is necessary to find a balance between the privacy and safety of the students through meaningful policy decisions that prioritize both.",Locker checks,5.0,367.0,17.0,21.58823529411765,40.0,13.0,10.882352941176473,190.0,0.3460490463215259,0.1144414168937329,0.0817438692098092,0.0163487738419618,0.0326975476839237,13.0,0.0710382513661202,6.588,0.4547738693467337,363.0,134.05976156568528,0.0,0.0,134.05976156568528,11.7,14.2,12.76,3.819696551782561,0.135,0.105,0.76,62.0,1.0,0.4648241206030151,0,0,1,1.0
"Technology has rapidly advanced in recent decades, and computers have come to play a crucial role in almost every area of life. Due to its efficiency, accuracy, and ability to perform tasks at a faster rate, the question of whether computers can replace man-power is a frequently debated topic. While computers can be beneficial in solving complex problems, it is doubtful that they can completely replace human labor in all spheres.

Firstly, computers cannot replicate the creativity and innovation of humans. Many jobs require individuals to think outside the box, and rely on spontaneous ideas, inventiveness, and creativity to achieve results. For example, jobs in fields such as art, literature, music, and design rely heavily on human creativity and cannot be done by computers solely.

Secondly, certain jobs require human interaction and empathy with clients or customers, such as healthcare professionals, counselors, and educators. These jobs require social, emotional and cognitive skills to handle personal and complex situations that a computer program may not be able to replicate. A personal connection, understanding emotions, having compassion, empathy, and aspiration cannot be matched by a computer. 

Thirdly, some jobs require manual dexterity and tactile experience, such as plumbing, carpentry, and other trades. Computers do not have the flexibility and accommodations to deal with equipment and tools in these fields as they are highly complex and require human expertise, training, and experience.

Moreover, it is important to note that job loss can result from the replacement of human labor with computers. Though automation and computers can increase the efficiency of many labor processes, it can also lead to fewer job opportunities, unemployment and can exacerbate inequality and wealth disparity.

In conclusion, while computers bring many benefits, there are still many fields where it cannot completely replace human labor. Computers are capable of performing many tasks but still lack human intelligence, adaptability, and creativity. The future of work involves working collaboratively with computers to find a balance between automation and human input, maintaining the human touch required in various jobs. As technology advances, it is important to be mindful of how it can best serve us rather than replace us, and we should continue to value and invest in human skills and talents in our work environments.",Computer replace  man power in jobs,6.0,373.0,17.0,21.94117647058824,37.0,10.0,10.235294117647058,222.0,0.3083109919571045,0.1581769436997319,0.1126005361930295,0.032171581769437,0.0375335120643431,10.0,0.0490196078431372,6.118,0.4930555555555556,372.0,145.96787002606678,0.0,0.0,145.96787002606678,14.2,15.7,14.04,4.27800512855197,0.121,0.048,0.832,63.0,1.0,0.4027777777777778,0,0,1,1.0
"Learning is a process of acquiring knowledge, skills, and abilities. In today's world, we have access to various sources of learning, including teachers, textbooks, online courses, and many others. However, there are different opinions about the effectiveness of learning from different sources. Some argue that learning from teachers is better, while others believe that other sources of learning are more effective. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of learning from teachers vs. other sources.

Firstly, learning from teachers has the advantage of being interactive. A teacher can answer questions, provide feedback, and engage in a dialogue with students, which can help deepen understanding and critical thinking skills. Additionally, the teacher can customize lessons to address the specific needs of each student, which can improve learning outcomes.

However, learning from other sources, such as textbooks, can be more flexible. Students can learn at their own pace, rewind the lesson and repeat it, and progress at a level that suits them best. This flexibility is beneficial as the learner's unique needs and learning pace are taken into consideration.

Another advantage of learning from a teacher is the sense of accountability and responsibility. Regularity and discipline can be facilitated by having a teacher. Assignments, reading assignments, and evaluations help the student to remain accountable and responsible. They can learn essential life lessons such as time management and organizational skills.

However, learning from other sources, such as online courses, can be self-directed, requiring the student to take greater responsibility for their own learning. Such self-paced courses also allow students to work at their own pace, take more time to deep-dive into topics or take on supplemental study without worryingÂ about holding the rest of the class behind.

Moreover, the quality of instruction can vary across different instructors, even in the same field. Some teachers may be more skilled, knowledgeable, effective, and experiential than others. Hence depending on a teacher alone may not offer the best quality of instruction, and seeking other sources to supplement instruction is sometimes a necessary approach.

In conclusion, learning from teachers and other sources each has its own unique benefits and drawbacks. Combining various sources of learning can be an excellent way to achieve a high-quality education. Students should be encouraged to explore different sources and methods of learning, and teachers should embrace technology and innovation while maintaining the traditional values of instruction like mentorship, guidance, and interaction. Today, the luxury of optionsÂ lets everyone to find a source of learning that best suits their needs and establishes a development path most comfortable and effective for them.",Lessons with teachers versus others sources,7.0,431.0,24.0,17.958333333333332,34.0,10.0,9.041666666666666,236.0,0.2946635730858468,0.1763341067285382,0.1229698375870069,0.0185614849187935,0.037122969837587,16.0,0.0727272727272727,6.12,0.4455645161290322,428.0,167.21044648201436,0.0,0.0,167.21044648201436,11.5,14.4,14.56,4.150342055473244,0.18,0.02,0.8,59.0,2.0,0.4375,6,3,2,1.0
"Email and text messaging have become an integral part of business and personal communication in today's world. While they provide a convenient and fast way to communicate, they have also become a platform for threats and harassment by using written language. A written threat can be very explicit and harmful, and it can create fear, anxiety, and even trauma. This essay will discuss the ways in which email and text messaging can be used as a tool for threats and harassment through written language.

Firstly, written threats are more powerful than verbal threats as they can be saved, forwarded or used as evidence. Due to the ability to store and share content, the impact of email and text message threats can be prolonged, and their damage inflicted beyond the immediate recipient. The recipient can continue to suffer the trauma from the message long after receiving it.

Secondly, written communication, especially through email and text messaging, can lack the social cues that express tone and intent. This lack of social cues can result in the misinterpretation of messages, leading to harm or injury. For instance, sarcasm in the written texts can be misunderstood and perceived as a threat leading to conflict.

Thirdly, the anonymity provided by email and text messaging can embolden individuals to make threats or engage in harassment, leading to cyberbullying. Cyberbullying can target anyone, including children, and result in severe mental health consequences such as depression, anxiety, and suicide.

Additionally, written language in email and text messages can be weaponized, especially in the workplace. An angry email or text message can be used to intimidate or coerce someone, leading to a hostile environment at work. It can also be used to undermine the reputation or standing of a colleague or competitor in the industry.

In conclusion, email and text messaging have revolutionized communication, providing efficiency and convenience.

"Animals have been used by human beings for various purposes for centuries. They have been used as sources of food, clothing, transportation, and entertainment. Moreover, they have also been used in research and medical experiments to develop new treatments and drugs. There are some drawbacks to using animals, but overall, their benefits are numerous, and their use should be continued.

One of the primary benefits of using animals is for food. Meat from animals provides an excellent source of high-quality protein and other essential nutrients that are necessary for human health. People have been consuming animal flesh for thousands of years, and it has become an integral part of human nutrition. Animals like sheep, goats, cows, and pigs can be raised and bred for human consumption. Animal meat is a vital aspect of several types of diets, including the paleo, keto, and carnivore diets.

Another benefit of animals is their use in transportation. Horses and camels have been used as transportation animals for centuries. Even today, they are still used in different parts of the world to carry goods and people. Dogs are also commonly used as transportation, serving purposes like pulling sleds in snowy areas and transferring patients to hospitals in ambulance services. The use of animals for transportation is still prevalent in remote villages, as they are more reliable than vehicles when used in tough terrains.

Animals have also been important for providing clothing and textiles. Wool from sheep, silk from silkworms, and leather from different animals have been used for clothing and other textile purposes for ages. Fur from animals like minks, foxes, and rabbits has been used for coats and clothing.

Another area where animals have been significant in service is in medical research. Many drugs and treatments were discovered following extensive research on different animal species. For instance, insulin used widely today was first developed using experiments on dogs. Medical experiments are conducted to test the safety and effectiveness of drugs before they are being used on human subjects. While some people criticize these tests for cruelty to animals, it is acknowledged that they have benefited humans immensely by making important medical discoveries.

Finally, animals also offer entertainment value to people. Kangaroos, lions, elephants, and tigers have become popular attractions in zoos and circuses worldwide. People enjoy watching shows and exhibitions that feature animals performing extraordinary stunts and tricks. Moreover, pets like dogs, cats, and birds also provide entertainment to people, as their funny and entertaining antics can make people happy and reduce their stress levels.

In conclusion, animals have played a crucial role in human civilization and continue to do so. Although the use of animals has some drawbacks, their benefits to humans are numerous. They provide essential resources for human nutrition, for transportation, for clothing, for medical research, and for entertainment. Therefore, people should continue to use animals in responsible ways and minimize their harm.",Using animals for the benefit of the human beings,7.0,482.0,30.0,16.066666666666666,27.0,8.0,7.633333333333334,253.0,0.3464730290456431,0.1141078838174273,0.0975103734439834,0.0207468879668049,0.0082987551867219,15.0,0.0590551181102362,5.233,0.4309090909090909,470.0,184.0157433944339,6.0,-0.2353084055284177,183.78043498890548,10.7,12.6,13.57,4.120051753500759,0.164,0.037,0.799,97.0,1.0,0.4163636363636364,0,0,1,1.0
"The topic of whether rich countries should help poor countries is a contentious issue that has been debated for decades. Some argue that wealthy nations have a moral obligation to assist their underprivileged counterparts. Others argue that each country should be responsible for its own economic progress and development. In this essay, I will critically analyze these arguments and explain why rich countries should assist poor countries.

The first reason why rich countries should help poor countries is that it is the right moral thing to do. For many years in history, rich countries actively exploited poor countries for their resources, labor, and economic benefits. The legacies of colonialism and imperialism still cause many countries to experience poverty and underdevelopment. Therefore, it is only fair for rich countries to assist poor countries in their development efforts. Developed countries should use their vast resources, technologies, and knowledge to help struggling nations.

The second reason why rich nations should assist poor countries is that the global economy is interdependent, and the failure of one nation to develop can have far-reaching effects. For instance, economic downturns and political instability in one country can cause a ripple effect on other neighboring nations. Hence, assisting developing countries to achieve economic growth, promote social development, and attain political stability can be beneficial for the global community. A more stable, equitable and prosperous global economy is advantageous for everyone.

Lastly, by helping poor countries, rich nations can foster intercultural understanding and enhance international relationships. Foreign aid provides an opportunity for rich countries to engage in mutually beneficial partnerships with developing nations. As rich countries help struggling nations, they can improve diplomatic relations, cultural understanding, and promote peace and stability in the global community. Richer countries can also benefit from the exchange of knowledge, resources, and ideas, which can stimulate innovation and promote international cooperation.

Some opponents argue that helping poor nations only promotes dependency on foreign aid and fails to address the root causes of poverty. However, foreign aid is only one aspect of the broader development process and should be implemented together with long-term initiatives aimed at promoting good governance, economic growth, and responsible resource management. It is essential to ensure that foreign aid is not diverted to corruption, ineffective programs, or used for a different purpose.

In conclusion, rich countries should help poor countries because it is the right thing morally, and a stable and prosperous global economy requires the engagement of all nations. Developed countries have a responsibility to enhance international cooperation, promote intercultural understanding and support their underdeveloped counterparts to achieve economic, social, and political development. By providing assistance, rich nations can foster mutually beneficial partnerships, reduce poverty, and create a more equitable global society.",Should rich countries help poor countries?,6.0,452.0,23.0,19.65217391304348,31.0,12.0,8.0,227.0,0.2743362831858407,0.1725663716814159,0.1880530973451327,0.0154867256637168,0.0376106194690265,21.0,0.0777777777777777,5.217,0.418467583497053,448.0,181.10410449342749,0.0,0.0,181.10410449342749,14.5,16.7,16.88,4.122283771066246,0.262,0.113,0.625,58.0,2.0,0.3614931237721022,8,3,3,1.0
"In recent years, the topic of gender equality has gained momentum, particularly in the education sector. Universities are no exception when it comes to issues of gender equality. Admission to universities has traditionally been prejudiced against women, but efforts are being made to change this. This essay argues that gender equality in university admission is essential and should be a priority.

Gender equality at university admission simply means equal opportunities for men and women to gain admission to higher education institutions regardless of their gender identity or expression. It seeks to eliminate discrimination based on gender and provide equal opportunities for all students, regardless of their gender. Equal opportunities mean that the admission criteria should be based on merit rather than gender, sexual orientation, or any other discriminatory factor.

It is essential to advocate for gender equality in university admission because it can break down gender stereotypes and promote awareness of gender diversity. When universities encourage gender equality in admission, they help students realize that gender should never be a determinant of an individual's ability. By allowing both equal access to higher education, universities give all students the chance to develop and improve their personal and professional skills, leading to healthier workplaces and communities.

Moreover, gender equality in admission can also help address gender disparities within the workforce. When there is a large gap in the number of men and women who have access to higher education, it leads to unequal labor opportunities. By ensuring that both genders have equal access to higher education, it gives them a level playing field in the workforce.

Gender equality in university admission can also improve diversity and inclusivity in the academic community. A diverse and inclusive university provides a better learning environment since students are exposed to different cultures, perspectives, and experiences. When universities prioritize gender equality, they broaden their pool of applicants, which, in turn, leads to more diverse learning communities representing diverse cultures, ethnicities, and beliefs.

Although significant progress has been made towards gender equality within tertiary education, there is still more work to be done. Educational institutions need to put in place affirmative action outcomes for gender diversity and promote mentorship programs to support students. Universities can achieve this by ensuring that they remove gender-biased admission systems and providing resources to help students succeed.

In conclusion, gender equality in university admission is an essential component in promoting equal opportunities for both men and women. Universities should strive to provide equal access to higher education to all students, regardless of their gender. Improvements must be made in the admission process to ensure diversity and inclusivity in academic environments, and overall gender disparity within the workforce can be addressed. By planning for gender diversity and inclusivity in university admissions, students can reach their full potential, and the community can benefit from their contributions.",Gender Equality at university admission,7.0,471.0,23.0,20.47826086956522,29.0,12.0,9.0,231.0,0.3609341825902335,0.1486199575371549,0.0870488322717622,0.0276008492569002,0.0254777070063694,22.0,0.0827067669172932,6.043,0.418426103646833,463.0,185.56102183664035,3.0,-0.1799815850420299,185.3810402515984,14.8,16.6,16.3,4.018723552875338,0.19,0.023,0.786,71.0,0.0,0.3973128598848368,14,6,3,1.0
"Museums are institutions that store, preserve, and exhibit artifacts of artistic, cultural, historical, or scientific significance. Over the years, museums have evolved to serve various purposes; some see museums as a form of entertainment, while others consider them as educational establishments. This essay will analyze the role of museums as a form of entertainment or education.

Museums can be viewed as a source of entertainment as they offer visitors opportunities to interact with new ideas, experiences, and amaze artifacts. They provide a platform for people to learn about and appreciate art and other artifacts, enhancing their enjoyment and emotional well-being as they engage in the exhibits. Museums are a place for families, friends, and individuals to come together and enjoy spending their leisure time exploring things they are curious about. This is evident in the various interactive exhibits, art installations, and scavenger hunts, all of which make museums an exciting destination for recreational purposes.

However, museums are also considered educational establishments because they give people a deeper understanding of the world around them. By presenting artifacts from different cultures and periods, museums allow visitors to experience the past, learn about new cultures, and appreciate the evolution of humanity and nature. Museums also offer educational programs that can explore topics in depth and include lectures, workshops, and tours. The educational aspect is crucial since it exposes visitors to ideas and concepts that they may not have experienced before, broadening their knowledge and understanding of the world.

Moreover, showcasing artifacts is not just about exploring the past, but also about understanding the present and future. Museums allow visitors to explore exhibits that highlight current events, such as climate change, public health, and activism, relevant to their daily lives. By presenting exhibits that address contemporary issues, museums can overcome the conception that museums are outdated and irrelevant to modern society.

In conclusion, museums play a critical role in both entertainment and education. While it is crucial for visitors to enjoy their time in a museum, institutions should also focus on presenting exhibits in an educational and meaningful way. Eradicating the perception that museums are antiquated establishments, and presenting contemporary issues in the exhibits is crucial in promoting museums as a source of knowledge and entertainment. Ultimately, it is only when visitors learn and relate to the artifacts that they can appreciate their significance and enjoy their museum experience.",Museums as a form of entertainment or education?,5.0,395.0,18.0,21.944444444444443,28.0,12.0,10.5,209.0,0.3063291139240506,0.1569620253164557,0.0987341772151898,0.030379746835443,0.0177215189873417,11.0,0.0531400966183574,6.944,0.4340044742729306,391.0,154.58245961032895,0.0,0.0,154.58245961032895,15.4,16.8,15.49,4.010576748487882,0.156,0.01,0.835,73.0,0.0,0.4228187919463087,4,2,2,1.0
"The emergence of computers has brought about significant advancements in our society. Children are exposed to technology at an early age and have access to computers and the internet. While computers have several benefits, they also have negative effects on children. This essay will explore the dangers of computer usage by children and the negative impact it can have on their overall well-being.

The first negative effect of computer usage on children is physical health problems. Computer usage often keeps children stationary and can lead to health issues such as obesity, poor eyesight, neck, back, and wrist pain. Moreover, the excessive use of computers can also lead to poor posture due to the tendency to slouch. The sedentary nature of computer usage may also impair children's physical development, resulting in a lack of coordination and balance.

Secondly, the use of computers by children for long periods can lead to psychological problems. The constant bombardment of information can lead to attention deficit disorder and short attention spans. Children who spend a lot of time on computers may also interact less with others, leading to social isolation. This can cause children to be anxious and depressed.

Thirdly, computers may expose children to inappropriate content. Many websites and videos on the internet have negative and damaging messages that are not suitable for children. Some children may unknowingly access these inappropriate materials through their internet search or links that appear on their screens. This can lead to children developing negative and harmful attitudes, leading to degradation of their moral principles.

Lastly, long hours spent on the computer can interfere with children's sleep patterns, leading to sleep deprivation. Lack of sleep can impair brain function, reduce concentration levels, affect mood, irritability, and behavior. Children who do not get sufficient rest may find it hard to concentrate in their schoolwork, leading to difficulty retaining and learning new information.

In conclusion, while computers have several benefits, they also have several negative impacts on children. The impact on children's physical and psychological health is of utmost concern. The exposure to inappropriate online content can also be harmful. Parents and guardians need to regulate children's computer usage through setting time limits and observing internet use for children's safety. Children should also be encouraged to engage in other physical activities and social interactions which will help them to maintain balance and live healthy lives.",computer has negative effects to children,6.0,394.0,24.0,16.416666666666668,25.0,8.0,7.541666666666667,208.0,0.3401015228426396,0.149746192893401,0.1243654822335025,0.0177664974619289,0.0456852791878172,16.0,0.0730593607305936,5.167,0.4604966139954853,393.0,148.9937378412397,1.0,-0.0040580607018623,148.9896797805378,10.9,13.2,14.21,3.998291058145664,0.044,0.169,0.786,52.0,0.0,0.4085778781038374,8,4,2,1.0
"Large factories have had a significant impact on the economies and societies where they are located. Throughout history, the development of factories has been associated with rapid industrialization and the modernization of societies. However, the influence of large factories extends beyond the economic benefits associated with manufacturing. This essay explores the influence of large factories on various aspects of society.

One of the primary impacts of large factories is the economic growth generated through job creation. The establishment of large factories often creates opportunities for people to secure employment, and this, in turn, helps to improve the local economy's standard of living. The employees of large factories spend their salaries in their communities, supporting local businesses and providing a demand for goods and services. Moreover, large factories also provide revenue to governments through taxes, fees, and levies, which support public services like education, healthcare, and infrastructure development.

The environmental impact of large factories is another significant concern. Large factories often emit pollutants into the atmosphere, such as greenhouse gases, sulfur dioxide, and other hazardous chemicals that may lead to pollution. Pollution can lead to a range of health problems for individuals living in close proximity to the factory, including respiratory illnesses and cancer. Additionally, large factories contribute significantly to water pollution. Industrial chemicals, waste, and byproducts from factories that find their way into rivers, streams, and oceans can harm aquatic life and affect human health.

Large factories can also impact social relations and lead to conflicts. Factories are often located in communities to take advantage of transport infrastructure, labor supply and proximity to raw materials. The influx of new workers can change the social dynamics in communities and lead to cultural tensions, which can cause social conflicts. Additionally, the activities of large factories may lead to the displacement of people from their homes, causing social and psychological unrest.

In conclusion, large factories have a significant impact on society, including economic growth, environmental degradation, and social and cultural changes. The development of large factories has led to explosive growth in manufacturing, which has had both positive and negative impacts on communities. It is crucial for policymakers to address the negative influence of large factories on the society and environment. Governments should enforce regulatory measures to ensure that factories operate in an environmentally-friendly way, minimize pollution and strengthen social relations, while promoting economic growth.",Influence Of Large Factory,5.0,392.0,21.0,18.666666666666668,26.0,8.0,7.619047619047619,216.0,0.3443877551020408,0.1326530612244898,0.1428571428571428,0.0051020408163265,0.0204081632653061,18.0,0.0769230769230769,6.429,0.4506726457399103,389.0,149.28759574227726,0.0,0.0,149.28759574227726,14.1,16.4,17.06,4.24929119091758,0.129,0.082,0.788,52.0,2.0,0.358744394618834,4,2,2,1.0
"Prepared food (also known as convenience food) is a type of food that has been processed and packaged for quick and easy consumption. This type of food has become increasingly popular due to the fast-paced lifestyle of modern society. While convenient, there are several pros and cons to consuming prepared food. This essay will examine the advantages and disadvantages of prepared food.

One of the primary advantages of prepared food is convenience. Busy individuals often do not have the time or energy to cook a meal from scratch. Prepared food offers a quick and easy solution to meet their dietary needs. The packaging of prepared foods, like frozen dinners, microwaveable meals, and pre-cut fruits and vegetables, provides quicker meal preparation with minimal preparation time, allowing people to spend more time on other activities.

Prepared food often has longer shelf life, when compared to fresh foods. This is achieved through processes like vacuum packaging, canning, freezing, pasteurization, and dehydration. A longer shelf life means that prepared food products can be stored for several months and are available when needed without the risk of spoiling. This is particularly useful for people who have busy schedules that make grocery shopping and meal preparation challenging.

Despite the convenience of prepared food, it is often more expensive than homemade, natural foods. This is because the cost of packaging, processing, and distribution is high. In comparison, fresh produce and natural ingredients are less expensive. Moreover, prepared food often contains high levels of sodium, sugars, and preservatives, making them less healthy options for daily consumption.

Another disadvantage is that prepared food may contribute to the widespread culture of on-the-go eating, which can lead to the development of bad eating habits. This habit, over time, can lead to an unhealthy lifestyle as people tend to consume fast food and processed foods that are high in fats and sugars and lack the necessary vitamins and minerals needed for the body. Thus, making them vulnerable to health problems like obesity, diabetes, heart diseases, and certain types of cancers.

In conclusion, while prepared foods offer the conveniences of easy storage, preparation, and quick access, it has its drawbacks. Prepared foods are often expensive, have high sugar and sodium levels and can lead to bad eating habits. While it is acceptable to consume occasional prepared meals, it is important to maintain a diet that consists of natural, whole foods, high in essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals. It is crucial to consider the nutritional content of meals, and the long term impact of less healthy dietary choices.",Prepared Food,6.0,424.0,23.0,18.43478260869565,38.0,10.0,8.0,235.0,0.3113207547169811,0.1084905660377358,0.1745283018867924,0.0212264150943396,0.0141509433962264,14.0,0.0573770491803278,6.348,0.4517453798767967,421.0,165.79556394579345,1.0,-0.0458603477969848,165.74970359799647,10.5,13.3,13.23,4.272573899216467,0.176,0.05,0.774,53.0,0.0,0.37782340862423,0,0,1,1.0
"Financial aid provided by developed countries to developing countries has become increasingly related to globalization and economic growth in the 21st century. This aid often takes the form of loans, grants, or other types of financial assistance to foster economic development, combat poverty, and promote political stability. This essay will analyze the importance of financial assistance to developing countries and the benefits it provides.

One of the primary benefits of financial aid is that it helps to finance crucial infrastructure and development projects in developing countries. These projects support critical services like water, healthcare, education, and sanitation systems. With the support of financial assistance, developing countries are better equipped to provide the necessary resources that support their citizen's livelihoods.

Financial aid also helps to combat poverty in developing countries. Many development programs focus on empowering the poor, including women, minorities, and the disadvantaged, by providing them with microfinancing, job training, and other social services. This contributes to the overall economic growth of developing nations, where the impoverished population is often the largest. In turn, this growth contributes to decreased poverty rates, improved living conditions and better social and economic prospects for the people.

The provision of financial assistance helps to establish stronger economic ties between developing and developed nations. Financial aid allows developing countries to develop industries, strengthen trade relationships, and participate in the global economy, creating incentives for other countries to engage with them. As the economies of these countries grow, they become more capable of contributing to the global system's economic and political landscape, promoting mutual interdependence and cooperation.

Providing financial aid to developing countries also promotes political stability. By providing much-needed resources, financial aid helps to reduce social unrest, combat corruption, and reduce the likelihood of conflicts between nations. The promotion of political stability is vital for the overall success of a nation, and it is crucial for sustainable economic growth and social development.

In conclusion, it is evident that financial assistance to developing countries plays a vital role in promoting economic growth, reducing poverty rates, and promoting political stability. These benefits allow developing countries to become more integrated into the global economic and political systems, fostering mutual interdependence and cooperation between developing and developed nations. Developed nations that offer financial aid can ultimately create a more prosperous and equitable global community that promotes the development and well-being of",Financial Aid To Developing Countries,6.0,392.0,19.0,20.63157894736842,26.0,10.0,8.0,190.0,0.2959183673469387,0.1760204081632653,0.1658163265306122,0.0178571428571428,0.0051020408163265,12.0,0.0491803278688524,6.474,0.4049773755656108,388.0,152.33521173567397,2.0,-0.1995832220935694,152.13562851358037,16.0,18.3,18.16,3.946389422324944,0.225,0.066,0.71,47.0,1.0,0.3438914027149321,4,2,2,1.0
"As an AI language model, I cannot provide you an opinion on this topic as I am programmed to remain neutral and unbiased. However, I can write an essay that presents arguments both in favor and against the statement ""Society should ban all forms of advertising.""

Advertising has become an integral part of modern society. It is used to promote various products and services, and it helps businesses connect with their target customers. However, there is a growing concern among people that advertising has a negative impact on society. Some argue that advertising creates false beliefs and promotes unrealistic expectations, promotes harmful products, and exploits vulnerable individuals. In light of these concerns, some people argue that society should ban all forms of advertising.

Those in favor of banning all forms of advertising believe that it is necessary to protect vulnerable individuals from the negative effects of advertising. For instance, children are commonly targeted by advertisements for unhealthy foods, which can lead to obesity, and other health problems. Moreover, advertising can also cultivate unrealistic expectations, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. By banning advertising, society would be protecting its citizens from these harmful effects.

On the other hand, critics argue that advertising is necessary for businesses to thrive, and it plays an important role in the economy. Without advertising, many businesses would be unable to promote their products and services effectively, leading to an overall decline in economic activity. Moreover, banning all forms of advertising would also limit the freedom of expression of businesses and individuals, who have the right to advertise their products and services.

Another argument against banning all forms of advertising is that it would be impossible to do so. Advertising takes many forms, including print, television, radio, and online media. Even if one form of advertising were banned, businesses could still find ways to promote their products through other channels, such as word-of-mouth marketing. Therefore, some might say that society should focus on regulating advertising instead of banning it completely.

In conclusion, while there are legitimate concerns about the negative effects of advertising, it is unrealistic to take the position that society should ban all forms of advertising. Rather, society should focus on regulating advertising to ensure that it is not harmful to its citizens. By doing so, society can protect vulnerable individuals while still allowing businesses to promote their products and services in a responsible and ethical manner.",Society should ban all forms of the advertising,6.0,406.0,21.0,19.33333333333333,28.0,9.0,10.0,211.0,0.2832512315270936,0.1773399014778325,0.0911330049261083,0.0369458128078817,0.041871921182266,17.0,0.085,5.652,0.4347826086956521,404.0,164.42369955772313,0.0,0.0,164.42369955772313,13.2,14.6,14.39,4.0147849351217655,0.116,0.127,0.758,57.0,0.0,0.4565217391304347,24,10,3,1.0
"The role of women in the workforce has changed significantly over the past few decades. With the growth of modern society and the rise of feminism, women are now more empowered to make choices regarding their careers and their families. However, there is still a societal stigma surrounding married women working. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons why some married women choose to work while others do not.

The decision to work outside the home is a personal one, and many married women choose to work because they find it fulfilling and rewarding. For some women, working helps them maintain a sense of identity and independence, while allowing them to contribute to their household's income. Having a job can also provide a sense of fulfillment, particularly for women who have invested significant time and resources to obtain an education or develop a skillset.

Moreover, some women need to work because of financial constraints. With rising costs of living, being a single-income household can be challenging, especially with children to support. Women who choose to work can contribute to the family's finances and provide a safety net in case of unexpected expenses.

However, there are reasons why some married women choose not to work. Some women feel that their primary responsibility is to their children and family and that they should focus on raising their children and managing their home. Others may find that their husband's income is sufficient to support the family's needs, and they prefer to dedicate their time to other pursuits.

Another factor that may influence a woman's decision to work is cultural and social expectations. Studies show that cultural norms and expectations can significantly influence a woman's decision to work, with women in more traditional societies expected to focus more on their family and home.

In conclusion, the decision on whether or not to work is a highly personal one and will depend on individual circumstances and preferences. While married women may face societal pressure to stay at home, many women choose to work because of financial constraints, a desire for personal fulfillment, independence, or other motivations. Ultimately, it is crucial to ensure that women have the freedom to make this choice for themselves, and that society does not limit their options based on outdated gender norms.",Do married women usually work?

"Education is an essential aspect of human development. It is the key to unlocking opportunities and realizing potential. In many countries, the government plays a significant role in the provision of education. The government's involvement in education ranges from financing education, providing the infrastructure and resources needed, and setting curriculum standards to monitoring the quality of education provided. In this essay, I will explore the relationship between government and education.

One of the key roles of the government in education is to ensure that education is accessible to all. Governments provide funding for education by allocating resources to educational institutions such as schools or libraries, and through scholarships and grants that can be used by students. The government's responsibility in this regard is to ensure that education is subsidised enough for students to access it.

Governments also ensure that the curriculum and the quality of education provided meet certain standards. They set up a regulatory framework that ensures that education providers are delivering education that is relevant and of high quality. This is done through the establishment of regulatory bodies that oversee educational institutions, set minimum curriculum standards, and ensure that these standards are met.

Furthermore, the government plays an important role in promoting research and innovation in the field of education. Governments often collaborate with academic institutions to promote research and innovation that can help improve the quality of education. This can lead to the development of new and innovative teaching methodologies that can improve student learning outcomes.

However, there are criticisms of government involvement in education. Some people argue that the government's involvement in education can compromise academic freedom. Governments may be seen to interfere in the curriculum or research, leading to a compromise on academic freedom. Others may argue that governments may not be as innovative as private investors, and hence, may limit educational advancements.

In conclusion, the government's involvement in education is crucial for the development of any country. While there are criticisms of the government's role in education, it is clear that governments play a critical role in providing equitable access to education and ensuring that education is of high quality. This is essential for the development of well-educated and informed citizens who can contribute positively to their societies and develop the skills and knowledge necessary to achieve success in life. Therefore, it is important for governments to remain committed to providing quality education to their citizens while respecting academic freedom.",Government And Education,6.0,406.0,22.0,18.454545454545453,33.0,8.0,9.181818181818182,188.0,0.3078817733990148,0.1600985221674876,0.083743842364532,0.022167487684729,0.0270935960591133,21.0,0.1,6.409,0.3995535714285714,406.0,162.70033478162213,0.0,0.0,162.70033478162213,14.0,15.3,15.95,3.771197590802938,0.181,0.024,0.795,54.0,1.0,0.4508928571428571,14,6,3,1.0
"Education is a vital component of a teenager's life. With the increasing demands of the modern world, there is a growing debate over whether students should learn all school subjects or focus on one area of study. In this essay, I will explore the arguments for and against teenagers learning all school subjects versus focusing on one area of study.

Those who advocate for teenagers to learn all school subjects believe that a comprehensive education is essential to ensure that students receive a well-rounded education. They argue that learning a broad range of subjects can help students develop a range of different skills, from critical thinking and problem-solving to creativity and communication. As such, teenagers who learn all school subjects are better prepared for the challenges they may encounter in the future, including those associated with further education and employment.

On the other hand, some people argue that teenagers should focus on one area of study, as this can help them develop a particular skill set that can be useful in future endeavors. These individuals argue that focusing on one subject can lead to early specialization and mastery of that subject, which can open up opportunities for specialization in higher education, research, or employment. Students may also be able to identify their areas of interest and develop a passion for a particular subject.

Another consideration is how educating teenagers at school can prepare them for specific jobs or career paths. Some careers require a depth of knowledge in a particular subject, such as medical care, law, and engineering. Thus, students pursuing these lines of work will benefit from focusing their education on specific subjects and disciplines instead of a wide range.

In conclusion, the debate of whether teenagers should learn all school subjects or focus on one subject is an ongoing one. While some argue that a comprehensive education is necessary, others believe that specialization can be advantageous. Perhaps the most significant consideration should be the individual student and their goals and interests. No matter what path the student chooses, it is essential that they develop the skills they need to be successful in their future endeavors. Also, teenagers should be exposed at least to the basics of all the school subjects to ensure they develop a well-rounded understanding of their environment and participate effectively in society.",should teenagers learn all school subjects/focus on one subject,5.0,387.0,17.0,22.764705882352946,33.0,9.0,11.764705882352942,192.0,0.2816537467700258,0.165374677002584,0.0930232558139534,0.0310077519379844,0.041343669250646,8.0,0.0418848167539267,7.0,0.4373522458628842,386.0,161.54317878998265,0.0,0.0,161.54317878998265,13.4,15.1,13.35,3.857235604646847,0.149,0.043,0.807,51.0,0.0,0.4728132387706856,17,8,3,1.0
"English language has a significant influence worldwide, as it has become the lingua franca of business, education, and diplomacy. While some argue that the influence of English has disadvantages such as the potential loss of linguistic diversity, the advantages are more significant and far-reaching. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages of the influence of English outweighing the disadvantages.

One of the primary advantages of the influence of English is the ease with which individuals and countries can communicate with each other. English is spoken by over one billion people worldwide, making it the most widely spoken language globally. This means that English speakers can communicate with people from diverse backgrounds, share ideas, and learn from each other. In this sense, the influence of English has promoted global understanding and harmony.

Moreover, English has become the primary language of international business, academic and educational purposes, and diplomacy. It is essential in fostering international cooperation and understanding. English is the language of choice for many businesses in countries that have different vernacular languages. Hence, proficiency in English can give individuals a competitive edge, expanding their access to employment opportunities, collaboration, and professional advancement. This trend has brought about more significant opportunities for individuals, driving economic growth and development.

Another advantage is the ease with which individuals can access knowledge through English language materials. The majority of scientific research and academic publications are written in English. The influence of English guarantees a broader reach of this information for individuals and countries at large, especially those whose vernacular languages may not be well-represented in the scientific and academic community.

In conclusion, while some may argue that the influence of English has its disadvantages, like the potential loss of linguistic diversity, the advantages of the influence of English outweigh the disadvantages. The dominance of English as a global language has brought about a more significant degree of global communication, facilitated learning, improved access to knowledge, and opened up more significant career opportunities. Therefore, to foster greater understanding and to participate in the global society, proficiency in English is essential. Hence, societies and individuals should embrace the influence of English and strive to promote its study.",Influence of English - advantages outweigh the disadvantages,5.0,362.0,19.0,19.05263157894737,32.0,9.0,9.263157894736842,174.0,0.2651933701657458,0.1132596685082873,0.1132596685082873,0.011049723756906,0.0220994475138121,18.0,0.0957446808510638,5.75,0.4068627450980392,354.0,139.18827713440868,5.0,-0.3496583492734795,138.8386187851352,14.3,16.4,16.88,3.80844503547722,0.153,0.05,0.797,48.0,0.0,0.4313725490196078,27,12,3,1.0
"Creativity is an essential component of human expression, and it is vital for innovation and progress in any society. However, the question of whether creativity should be given freedom or restrictions is a contentious one. While some argue that freedom fosters creativity, others believe that limitations are necessary for creative expression. In this essay, I will explore the arguments for and against both perspectives.

Those who advocate for freedom in creativity believe that creativity must be allowed to flow freely. They argue that creatives must not be boxed in with restrictions as it will thwart the possibilities for originality and innovation. Creatives should have the liberty to express their ideas without fear of rejection or judgment. Moreover, the freedom to create can stimulate unconventional thought processes, leading to bolder and more imaginative ideas.

On the other hand, others argue that the imposition of limits and restrictions is essential for creative expression. Limitations in the creative process can turn abstract ideas into concrete reality because creative boundaries can permit severe experimenting and increase the quality of work. The constraints may serve to help the creative process become more focused and structure, as the creative has to be mindful of fulfilling a particular criterion. This criteria-focused structure may lead to deeper personal growth and development as well.

Additionally, restrictions can provide an opportunity to push against the boundaries, opening up dialogue and conversation that promotes innovation and creativity. In this sense, limitations can become a tool for unleashing creativity, free from the lingering anxiety of lack of direction or clarity.

In conclusion, the debate of whether creativity should be given freedom or restrictions is on-going. While some argue that allowing absolute creative freedom is necessary, others believe that restrictions should be in place to promote innovation. Perhaps the optimal approach lies in finding the correct balance between freedom and limitations. Creativity should be encouraged, and guidelines must be in place. Creatives should be able to experiment with their ideas while also aiming to meet particular criteria. Either way, whichever approach to creativity, the pursuit of inspiration, and the encouragement of new ideas is paramount, as it is so integral to human experience.",creativity-should it be given freedom or restrictions,5.0,360.0,20.0,18.0,26.0,10.0,9.15,195.0,0.2861111111111111,0.1722222222222222,0.1,0.0166666666666666,0.05,8.0,0.0446927374301676,5.7,0.4686716791979949,357.0,143.45117809782585,0.0,0.0,143.45117809782585,12.7,14.4,14.73,4.122219485083537,0.32,0.051,0.629,58.0,1.0,0.4586466165413533,12,6,2,1.0
"Competition and cooperation are two fundamental concepts that play a crucial role in human interactions. While both concepts have their benefits, the question of whether competition or cooperation is better has been a topic of debate for years. In this essay, I will explore the arguments for and against the two concepts.

Competition encourages individuals to excel at what they do, whether in academics, sports, or business. It promotes innovation and creativity, as participants strive to find new and better ways of doing things. Competition allows people to push themselves to their limits, building resilience and perseverance. In a competitive environment, individuals can learn how to handle failure and use it as a motivator for future success.

On the other hand, cooperation promotes teamwork and collaboration. It encourages individuals to work with others to achieve common goals. Cooperation allows people to learn from one another, providing an opportunity for exchanging ideas and expertise, which can result in better outcomes. Cooperation promotes mutual respect and fosters social connections that can increase an individual's sense of community and belonging.

However, there are circumstances when competition may not be suitable, and it may lead to negative consequences. For instance, competition can be detrimental when it creates a tense, stress-inducing environment. Furthermore, too much focus on competition can promote a culture of individualism and lead to feelings of isolation and disillusionment. Competitiveness can also promote discrimination against and overlooking marginalized participants, which is unacceptable.

On the other hand, cooperation can be hampered when there is unequal participation in the collaborative environment, or when individuals are not willing to compromise. Cooperation can sometimes lead to groupthink, not allowing the incorporation of new ideas or dissenting opinions that could enhance cooperation.

In conclusion, whether competition or cooperation is better ultimately depends on the situation at hand. Neither is inherently better or worse than the other. It is crucial to understand that in many instances, competition or cooperation could merely be two sides of the same coin.  Both concepts have their pros and cons, and what is needed is to ensure the balance between competition and cooperation. When there is a healthy harmony between the two, there can be room for healthy competition without compromising on collaboration and vice versa.",competition or co-operation-which is better,6.0,373.0,22.0,16.954545454545453,25.0,9.0,8.863636363636363,205.0,0.2841823056300268,0.1554959785522788,0.0884718498659517,0.0402144772117962,0.0375335120643431,8.0,0.0444444444444444,5.136,0.4761904761904761,366.0,148.46238425043217,2.0,-0.050388200677808,148.41199604975438,13.5,14.0,14.9,4.33634815633067,0.189,0.06,0.751,64.0,1.0,0.4642857142857143,6,3,2,1.0
"Capital punishment, commonly known as the death penalty, is a highly debated topic that has served as justification for the imposition of punishment for numerous crimes since time immemorial. Some argue that capital punishment is necessary to discourage violent crime, while others believe that it is fundamentally flawed and violates fundamental human rights. In this essay, I will explore both argumentative sides on whether capital punishment is necessary or not.

Those who advocate for capital punishment argue that it is a necessary tool in maintaining law and order within society. They argue that the severity of the punishment serves as a significant deterrent for crimes such as murder, and that its use has resulted in a decrease in violent crime rates in some societies. According to them, capital punishment ensures that the most heinous crimes receive the most significant penalty, which serves as a potent message to potential perpetrators.

On the other hand, many others argue that capital punishment is fundamentally flawed, barbaric, ineffective, and often used unfairly. Those against capital punishment argue that there is little evidence to suggest that the death penalty is effective in reducing violent crime rates. Moreover, they contend that the use of capital punishment ultimately undermines the dignity of human life and neglect basic human rights. Furthermore, it is argued that a death penalty sentencing regime often results in unfair treatment of minorities and those without financial resources who cannot afford quality representation.

Finally, the human fallibility in the criminal justice system also makes the use of capital punishment suspect. Mistakes in identification, false testimony, and the bungling of evidence have resulted in innocent individuals being sentenced to death. This has resulted in instances when those sentenced to death were later found innocent, raising concern on the thoroughness of the criminal justice system.

In conclusion, the debate on the necessity of capital punishment is not without contention. The reality is that the death penalty is a crucial component in differing legal systems at different times. However, the disadvantageous human and societal implications surrounding capital punishment call into question its continued application. Hence, the need for continual reevaluation of the methods of punishment. Perhaps most importantly, with modern advancements in criminal justice regimes, alternative methods of punishment have proven to be much more effective, just, and fair with less impact on human dignity.",capital punishment..necessary or not,5.0,388.0,18.0,21.55555555555556,34.0,11.0,10.055555555555555,216.0,0.2989690721649484,0.1056701030927835,0.1314432989690721,0.0257731958762886,0.0051546391752577,15.0,0.0721153846153846,6.333,0.4779582366589327,382.0,151.32709441757325,2.0,-0.1428028158875497,151.18429160168571,14.1,16.1,14.97,4.377978007269695,0.079,0.327,0.594,56.0,0.0,0.419953596287703,8,4,2,1.0
"The question of whether a break after high school is good or bad for students is a topic of continued debate. Some argue that taking a break is a positive and necessary step that allows students to recharge and gain perspective before starting college. Others argue that prolonged breaks can be detrimental to academic performance and discourage students from continuing their education. In this essay, I will discuss both arguments.

Advocates of taking a break after high school believe that students need time to rest and recharge. This time away from studies allows for personal growth and development, allowing students to explore different interests and gain perspective on their future academic and career paths. They argue that students who take breaks before starting college can enter the academic world with a fresh outlook, renewed motivation, and better equipped to handle the rigors of academic life.

On the other hand, those who oppose taking an extended break believe that students can lose momentum in their academic pursuits, leading to a loss of focus and motivation. According to them, students who take an extended break may be less likely to continue their education, making them less competitive in the workforce in the long run. The risk is that taking prolonged breaks could lead to a lack of interest in returning to their studies, as they may get comfortable with their new-found freedom and flexibility.

Another consideration is the disruption in academic progress that extended breaks can cause. When students take a break before starting college, they miss out on developing vital skills that are covered in the subjects they have chosen and already plan to study in college. Additionally, students who take extended breaks may also find it challenging to catch up with their peers when they resume their studies.

In conclusion, while there are arguments for and against taking a break after high school, it is important to consider the individual studentâ€™s circumstances and goals when making such a decision. Unless it is due to exceptional reasons like health, societal or familial obligations, students may embrace the momentum already gained from their high school career and not take an extended break so that they can leap forward in their academics. However, taking small breaks to recharge or for personal development can be highly beneficial as long as the studentsâ€™ momentum is not lost.

"In today's society, a growing trend can be observed: more and more individuals are opting to live independently. This transformation in living arrangements is a subject of significant debate regarding its causes and consequences. Examining the reasons behind this shift, as well as the potential effects on individuals and society, provides valuable insights into the current dynamics of modern living.

One primary factor contributing to the surge in people living alone is the desire for independence. Many individuals find solace in the freedom to make their own decisions and enjoy a sense of autonomy in their lives. By living alone, they do not have to consider the needs or preferences of others, allowing them to prioritize their own desires and set their own pace. This newfound independence can empower individuals and promote personal growth and development.

Furthermore, economic factors play a substantial role in the decision to live independently. In today's fast-paced and competitive world, individuals often face demanding work schedules and extensive commutes. As a result, living alone becomes a convenient option, offering a respite from the daily grind and reducing the burdens of coordination with others. Moreover, solo living eliminates the need to share expenses, allowing individuals to have more disposable income and control over their financial destinies.

However, it is important to acknowledge that living alone does not come without potential consequences. One significant concern is the impact on mental health. Living in isolation can result in feelings of loneliness and isolation, which can have detrimental effects on an individual's overall well-being. Therefore, it is essential for those who choose to live alone to actively seek social connections and foster relationships to counteract these adverse effects.

From a broader societal perspective, the rise in individuals living alone has implications for community cohesion. Traditional social structures, such as families or shared living arrangements, have historically played a crucial role in supporting and nurturing individuals. With the decline in such arrangements, it is essential for society to adapt and provide alternative support systems to aid in individuals' well-being. This might include creating opportunities for interaction and fostering social networks that can alleviate the negative consequences often associated with living alone.

In conclusion, the growing number of people choosing to live independently is a trend that has emerged due to various factors influencing modern society. While the desire for independence and economic considerations contribute to this decision, it is crucial to recognize the potential challenges that arise from living alone, such as mental health concerns.

"There is an ongoing debate on whether living in metropolises has detrimental effects on people's health. While some argue that cities provide numerous advantages that contribute to a healthier lifestyle, I firmly believe that residing in metropolises can have adverse effects on individuals' well-being.

Firstly, metropolises are known for their pollution levels, which significantly impact public health. The concentration of vehicles, factories, and other sources of pollution in cities contribute to the poor air quality residents are exposed to daily. Studies have consistently shown that long-term exposure to air pollution leads to respiratory problems, cardiovascular diseases, and even premature death. Considering the high population density in metropolises, the number of individuals affected by these health issues is substantially higher compared to rural areas.

Secondly, the fast-paced lifestyle in cities often creates stress and mental health problems among residents. The hustle and bustle of city life, combined with workplace pressure and long commuting hours, result in higher stress levels. This chronic stress can lead to several adverse health effects, including hypertension, heart diseases, and a weakened immune system. Moreover, the lack of green spaces and the constant noise and congestion in metropolises can further exacerbate mental health issues like anxiety and depression.

Furthermore, living in a metropolis frequently entails unhealthy dietary habits. The accessibility of fast-food chains and the limited availability of fresh, healthy food options in many cities have led to an increase in unhealthy eating habits among urban dwellers. The consumption of processed foods, high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats, has become widespread, contributing to the rise of obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related diseases. In contrast, rural areas often offer a healthier and more varied range of locally sourced, fresh produce.

Moreover, sedentary lifestyles have become a common attribute of city residents. Long working hours and commuting times, combined with the convenience of cars and public transportation, have led to a decrease in physical activity levels. Without intentional efforts to engage in regular exercise, city dwellers are more prone to leading sedentary lives. This lack of physical activity has a detrimental impact on overall health and increases the risk of obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic disorders.

In conclusion, living in metropolises has several negative consequences on people's health. Pollution, stress, unhealthy dietary habits, and sedentary lifestyles are prevalent in urban environments and significantly contribute to various health issues.

"Nowadays, with the rise of the internet and social media, staying updated with the latest news has become easier than ever. However, some people argue that following the news is a waste of time. In my opinion, I strongly disagree with this notion. This essay will discuss the benefits of staying informed and why it is crucial to follow the news regularly.

To begin with, following the news helps individuals stay informed about current events. In our fast-paced world, being aware of what is happening around us is essential. News provides us with information about local and global events, politics, economy, science, technology, and more. For instance, during a pandemic like COVID-19, being updated with the latest news and health guidelines helps individuals take necessary precautions, protect themselves, and prevent the spread of the virus.

Furthermore, staying informed enables individuals to engage in meaningful conversations and discussions. News often focuses on relevant and important topics, which can spark debates and raise awareness. By following the news, individuals have the opportunity to expand their knowledge, develop critical thinking skills, and form opinions based on reliable information. This can lead to informed decision-making and active participation in societal matters.

Moreover, following the news nurtures a sense of belonging and community. News often covers stories of human achievements, struggles, and shared experiences. When individuals are aware of these stories, they feel connected to others and gain a sense of empathy. This sense of connection motivates people to take actions, support social causes, and contribute to positive change. For example, news about environmental issues may inspire individuals to adopt sustainable practices or support initiatives aimed at protecting the planet.

In addition to these benefits, staying informed through the news helps individuals develop a broader perspective. It exposes them to different cultures, ideologies, and viewpoints. This exposure fosters tolerance, empathy, and understanding towards diverse communities and perspectives. By being aware of various opinions, individuals can become more open-minded and capable of making informed judgments.

In conclusion, following the news is far from being a waste of time. Instead, it is a valuable activity that keeps individuals informed about crucial events, fosters engagement in discussions, nurtures a sense of belonging, and broadens perspectives.

"Global warming is a pressing issue that has gained significant attention in recent years. There is an increasing body of evidence that points towards human activities as the main cause of the rising global temperatures. This essay will discuss the various ways in which man-made activities are contributing to the high global temperatures.

Firstly, the combustion of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas for energy production is a major contributor to global warming. These activities release carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, creating a thick blanket that traps heat. The continuous burning of fossil fuels for electricity generation, transportation, and industrial processes has resulted in a substantial increase in atmospheric CO2 levels, leading to a rise in global temperatures.

Furthermore, deforestation and land-use changes play a significant role in causing high global temperatures. Forests act as carbon sinks, absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere and storing it in trees and soil. However, widespread deforestation, primarily for agricultural expansion and urbanization, has resulted in the release of large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. Additionally, the removal of vegetation disrupts the natural balance of the ecosystem, reducing the Earth's capacity to absorb CO2 and exacerbating the greenhouse effect.

Another man-made activity that contributes to global warming is the intensification of agriculture. The increasing demand for food has led to the expansion of agricultural lands and the use of chemical fertilizers. These fertilizers release nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. Additionally, the livestock industry produces methane (CH4) from animal waste and enteric fermentation, which further contributes to global warming.

Additionally, industrial processes and waste management practices contribute significantly to the high global temperatures. The manufacturing sector releases a wide range of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, and fluorinated gases, during the production and use of various products. Moreover, improper waste management, particularly the decomposition of organic waste in landfills, generates methane emissions. These industrial processes and waste management practices significantly contribute to the overall greenhouse gas emissions, subsequently causing global warming.

Lastly, changes in land use and urbanization also contribute to increasing global temperatures. The expansion of cities and urban areas results in the paving over of natural land surfaces, increasing the absorption of solar energy and creating what is known as the ""urban heat island"" effect. This phenomenon causes localized temperature increases, adding to the overall rise in global temperatures.

In conclusion, the evidence indicates that man-made activities are indeed making global temperatures high. The burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, intensification of agriculture, industrial processes, and changes in land use all contribute to the increase in global temperatures. Addressing these activities and adopting sustainable practices is crucial to mitigate the impacts of global warming and ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.",There is growing evidence that man-made activities are making global temperatures high,7.0,462.0,24.0,19.25,33.0,13.0,7.291666666666667,231.0,0.3636363636363636,0.1147186147186147,0.1341991341991342,0.0064935064935064,0.0021645021645021,14.0,0.047945205479452,5.667,0.4113207547169811,453.0,162.39915075991922,7.0,-0.4864171251704246,161.91273363474878,14.4,16.8,17.06,4.389535686975924,0.084,0.032,0.884,53.0,1.0,0.330188679245283,8,4,2,1.0
"Education and economic development are closely intertwined.

Non-smokers have the right to breathe clean air and should not be subjected to the harmful chemicals and toxins present in secondhand smoke. Implementing a ban on smoking in public places ensures the protection of individuals from this involuntary inhalation of smoke.

Secondly, smoking in public places has a direct negative impact on public health. By imposing a ban on smoking in such areas, governments play a crucial role in safeguarding the well-being of their citizens. The inhalation of secondhand smoke significantly increases the risk of health problems, particularly for vulnerable individuals such as children, pregnant women, and those with pre-existing health conditions. This ban is justified to promote public health and reduce the burden on healthcare systems caused by smoking-related illnesses.

Lastly, it is essential to create and promote a smoke-free environment in public places. Encouraging a smoke-free atmosphere not only protects the health of non-smokers but also helps smokers to quit or reduce their smoking habits. By limiting the opportunities for smokers to light up in public spaces, it can motivate them to seek alternatives, such as smoking cessation programs or nicotine replacement therapy, ultimately leading to a decline in smoking rates. Furthermore, fostering a smoke-free environment helps to prevent the normalization of smoking, especially among impressionable youth, and promotes a healthier lifestyle overall.

In conclusion, the ban on smoking in public places is entirely justified. The detrimental effects of secondhand smoke, the burden on public health, and the need to promote a smoke-free environment all provide compelling reasons for implementing such a ban. By enacting and strictly enforcing these policies, governments can protect the health and well-being of their citizens, minimize the risks associated with secondhand smoke, and contribute to a healthier society overall.",Smoking in public places - the ban is justified,6.0,410.0,18.0,22.77777777777778,36.0,12.0,9.88888888888889,203.0,0.3195121951219512,0.1414634146341463,0.1292682926829268,0.0073170731707317,0.0121951219512195,14.0,0.0578512396694214,7.167,0.4269911504424779,414.0,150.2198666384627,0.0,0.0,150.2198666384627,13.3,16.4,14.86,4.233679508575301,0.118,0.122,0.761,59.0,8.0,0.3938053097345133,51,22,4,1.0
"Assessment plays a crucial role in determining the abilities of students and their overall academic progression. It provides valuable insights into their knowledge, skills, and understanding of the subject matter. This essay will explore the significance of assessment in evaluating students' abilities and discuss various assessment methods in education.

Assessment allows educators to gauge students' understanding and identify areas where they may need further support. By evaluating their performance, teachers can tailor their instruction to address individual needs effectively. Additionally, assessment serves as a motivating factor for students, as it provides them with a sense of accomplishment and encourages them to strive for better academic performance.

There are several ways to assess students' abilities. Firstly, traditional exams and tests remain a common method to measure knowledge retention and application. These assessments typically evaluate students' comprehension of curriculum content, ability to recall facts, and capacity to solve problems within a given time frame.

"In recent years, the rise in popularity of electronic books, also known as e-books, has led to a shift in reading habits, with more individuals opting for this digital format over paper books. While this trend has its advantages, such as convenience and environmental benefits, it also brings with it certain disadvantages. This essay will discuss both the advantages and disadvantages of this growing preference for e-books and determine whether or not the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.

One of the primary advantages of reading e-books is the convenience they offer. With electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, and e-readers, individuals can carry thousands of books in a single portable device. This portability allows people to access their favorite books anywhere, anytime, without the need for physical space to store them. Moreover, e-books enable readers to adjust the font size and brightness to suit their preferences, making reading more comfortable, particularly for those with visual impairments. Therefore, the convenience of e-books undoubtedly outweighs the disadvantages.

In addition to convenience, e-books also contribute to environmental sustainability. The production of paper books requires extensive use of natural resources, including trees and water. On the other hand, e-books eliminate the need for paper, reducing deforestation, water pollution, and carbon emissions from book manufacturing. Consequently, choosing e-books over paper books demonstrates an individual's commitment to protecting the environment. This significant advantage further supports the argument that the benefits of this trend supersede the disadvantages.

However, despite these advantages, the popularity of e-books has its downsides. Firstly, not everyone has access to electronic devices required for reading e-books. In many developing countries, the lack of necessary technology limits individuals' ability to engage with electronic literature. Additionally, e-books often require a stable internet connection for downloading and accessing online libraries. Therefore, this accessibility issue can be considered a significant disadvantage of this trend.

Another disadvantage of e-books is the potential impact on the reading experience itself. Some readers argue that the physical act of turning pages and holding a book enhances their overall enjoyment and engagement with the text. Paper books also create a sense of nostalgia and offer a break from screen time, which is increasingly dominant in modern society. This emotional connection and sensory experience cannot be replicated by e-books, resulting in a loss for those who prefer the traditional format.

In conclusion, while the increasing popularity of e-books has its disadvantages, such as limited access in developing countries and a potential impact on the reading experience, the advantages of convenience and environmental sustainability outweigh the drawbacks. The convenience of carrying numerous books in a single device, with the ability to adjust font size and brightness, along with the positive environmental impact of reducing paper usage, make e-books a favorable choice.

While there are clear advantages to this phenomenon, it is also important to acknowledge the disadvantages that come with global communication.

Firstly, global communication has revolutionized the way we connect with others around the world. Social media platforms, online forums, and video conferencing tools have made it easier than ever to interact and collaborate with individuals from different backgrounds. This open line of communication promotes cultural understanding, fosters global friendships, and encourages the sharing of ideas and knowledge.

Additionally, global communication has greatly impacted international trade and commerce. Businesses can easily reach potential customers in different countries through online marketplaces, advertising campaigns, and e-commerce platforms. This global connectivity has enabled small businesses to expand their reach and compete in the international market, leading to increased economic growth and opportunities.

Furthermore, global communication has had a significant impact on education. With access to online courses, students from around the world can now learn from renowned experts without the limitations of physical distance.

"Scientific research plays a vital role in advancing knowledge and driving innovation. However, the question of whether this research should be conducted by private companies or the government is a complex one. In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and argue that a combination of both is necessary for the progress of society.

On one hand, private companies have the financial resources and flexibility to conduct research efficiently. They often have access to a wide range of expertise and state-of-the-art facilities, enabling them to pursue innovative ideas. Moreover, the profit motive in the private sector can drive companies to develop research findings into marketable products and services. This commercialization can lead to economic growth and job creation, benefiting society as a whole.

On the other hand, government-funded research has certain advantages. Firstly, the government can prioritize research in areas that are of strategic importance to the nation, addressing societal challenges such as healthcare, climate change, and national security. Government-led research also tends to have a long-term perspective, focusing on knowledge generation rather than immediate profitability. This allows for potentially groundbreaking discoveries with profound societal impact, such as the development of vaccines or the exploration of renewable energy sources.

However, each approach has its drawbacks. Private companies may prioritize profit over societal benefits, potentially leading to biases in research findings or neglecting certain areas of research that are not deemed profitable. Government-funded research, though driven by societal goals, can be slow and bureaucratic, lacking entrepreneurial spirit and efficiency. Moreover, political interference can hinder the autonomy of scientists and the objectivity of research outcomes.

Given these pros and cons, a hybrid model is necessary for optimal scientific progress. Collaboration between private companies and government agencies can leverage the strengths of both sectors. Public-private partnerships can ensure that research is conducted in socially relevant domains, while also benefiting from the agility and resources of private entities. This approach allows for the efficient commercialization of discoveries while maintaining the societal focus required for long-term progress.

Furthermore, fostering a culture of open collaboration and knowledge sharing is crucial. Crowdsourcing scientific research and encouraging collaboration across sectors can enhance innovation and breakthroughs. Initiatives such as open-source platforms and research consortia can bridge the gap between private and government research and facilitate the exchange of ideas and findings.

Embracing a hybrid model that combines the strengths of both sectors, along with an open collaborative culture, is crucial for societal progress and ensuring that scientific research benefits the broader public.",should scientific research be conducted by private companies or the govt,7.0,453.0,25.0,18.12,31.0,6.0,7.88,244.0,0.3399558498896247,0.1434878587196468,0.141280353200883,0.0066225165562913,0.0309050772626931,18.0,0.0671641791044776,5.68,0.4554455445544554,458.0,172.58354102555495,0.0,0.0,172.58354102555495,13.9,17.1,17.86,4.369503195143102,0.198,0.02,0.782,71.0,0.0,0.3900990099009901,16,8,2,1.0
"In recent years, the widening income gap has become a topic of concern for many individuals and societal organizations. Some argue that governments should impose a cap on salaries to address this issue. This essay will delve into this subject, examining both the advantages and disadvantages of restricting salaries above a certain level.

Primarily, implementing a maximum salary could help mitigate income inequality. Currently, there are numerous instances of top-level executives earning exorbitant amounts of money, while the majority of the population struggles to make ends meet. By setting a limit on how much an individual can earn, resources could be more equitably distributed among the populace. This could lead to a more balanced and just society, as essential services and public welfare would be prioritized over excessive wealth accumulation for a select few.

Moreover, capping salaries would contribute to improving social cohesion. The wide disparity in income often creates divisions within societies, fostering feelings of resentment and inequality. By implementing a maximum wage, governments would signal their commitment to closing the gap between the rich and the poor, fostering a sense of unity and shared societal progress. This could lead to increased social harmony and a reduction in societal tensions, ultimately benefiting the overall well-being of the nation.

On the other hand, there are valid arguments against governmental intervention in salary levels. One of the key arguments is the potential negative impact on economic growth. Critics argue that high salaries serve as incentives for individuals to strive for excellence and entrepreneurial success. By removing the possibility of earning higher wages, there is a risk that talented individuals may lose motivation, resulting in reduced innovation and economic productivity. This could have detrimental effects on a country's overall economic development and competitiveness in the global market.

Furthermore, opposition to salary restrictions contends that such policies could lead to a brain drain. Talented individuals may choose to relocate to countries where there is more freedom in earning potential, lowering the overall human capital of the nation. This could result in reduced competitiveness and hinder the progress of various sectors, including science, technology, and arts. In the long run, this could have severe consequences for a country's ability to thrive and excel on the international stage.

In conclusion, the idea of limiting salaries above a certain level is a contentious one. While there are compelling arguments in favor of implementing such policies, such as reducing income inequality and fostering social unity, it is important to consider potential negative repercussions, including negative impacts on economic growth and the potential brain drain effect. Ultimately, finding a balance between addressing income disparity and maintaining a vibrant economy is a complex task for governments, one that requires careful consideration and thoughtful policy-making.",Governments should not allow salaries above a certain level,6.0,455.0,23.0,19.782608695652176,40.0,9.0,9.0,263.0,0.2923076923076923,0.1736263736263736,0.1428571428571428,0.0131868131868131,0.0351648351648351,5.0,0.0197628458498023,6.391,0.504930966469428,454.0,173.14069358307145,0.0,0.0,173.14069358307145,13.4,15.7,15.49,4.692394377516134,0.171,0.107,0.722,56.0,1.0,0.408284023668639,2,1,2,1.0

They no longer have to spend hours commuting to and from the office, allowing more time for family, hobbies, and personal pursuits. Additionally, working from home can reduce stress levels, as individuals are free from the pressures often associated with a traditional office environment, such as long hours and dealing with difficult colleagues.

Moreover, the accessibility of technology has afforded children the opportunity to study from home. This has several advantages, particularly for those who live in remote areas or have difficulties accessing traditional educational institutions. Remote learning allows for a more individualized and personalized approach to education, catering to the specific needs and learning styles of each child. Furthermore, studying from home can promote self-discipline and independence as children are required to manage their time effectively, set goals, and complete tasks without constant supervision.

However, there are also some notable drawbacks to this development. Firstly, the lack of face-to-face interaction can lead to a decrease in social skills development for both adults and children. Human interaction is an essential aspect of personal development, and relying solely on virtual communication may hinder the development of crucial communication and collaboration skills. Additionally, the increased reliance on technology may lead to a sedentary lifestyle, as individuals spend prolonged periods sitting in front of a computer screen. This lack of physical activity can have detrimental effects on overall health and wellbeing.

Another disadvantage is the potential for increased distractions while working or studying from home. Home environments can often be filled with distractions such as family members, household chores, or personal gadgets. This can affect productivity and concentration, causing individuals to struggle in meeting deadlines or retaining information effectively. In a traditional setting, there is a clear boundary between work/school and home life, while working or studying from home blurs these lines, potentially leading to a decrease in overall performance.

Overall, the increased accessibility and affordability of technology has undoubtedly changed the way adults work and children learn. While there are clear benefits, such as increased flexibility and individualized learning, there are also significant drawbacks, including reduced social interactions and potential distractions. It is crucial for individuals and society to strike a balance between utilizing technology for convenience and maintaining the essential aspects of human connection and physical activity.","many adults are working from home, and more children are beginning to study from home because technology has become cheaper and more accessible.

"Studies suggest that many teenagers these days prefer socializing online to meeting one another in person. There are several factors that contribute to this phenomenon.

First and foremost, the rise of social media platforms and online communication tools has made it easier than ever for teenagers to connect with their peers. These digital platforms provide a sense of convenience and instant gratification, allowing teenagers to interact with others without the need for physical proximity. With just a few taps on a screen, they can chat, share photos, and engage in various activities, all from the comfort of their own homes.

Another reason is that socializing online offers teenagers a sense of control over their social interactions. In face-to-face encounters, teenagers often face the pressure of conforming to social norms and expectations, which can be intimidating and overwhelming. On the other hand, online platforms provide them with the opportunity to shape their online identity, presenting themselves in a way that aligns with their desired image. This level of control gives them a sense of empowerment and reduces the fear of judgment or rejection.

Furthermore, socializing online offers a wider range of social connections. In the digital world, teenagers can engage with people from different backgrounds, cultures, and even geographical locations. This diversity expands their social networks, exposes them to different perspectives, and broadens their horizons. In contrast, meeting peers in person often restricts teenagers to interact with a limited group of individuals, mainly those within their immediate circle or community.

Additionally, the virtual world provides a sense of anonymity and protection. Many teenagers find it easier to express themselves and share their thoughts and emotions online, where they are shielded by a screen. This anonymity allows them to be more open and honest, creating a sense of comfort that may not exist in face-to-face interactions. Consequently, they may prefer the safety net provided by online socializing, where they can be more expressive without fear of immediate judgment or consequences.

Lastly, the busy and demanding nature of modern teenage life may contribute to the preference for online socializing. Teenagers today often have packed schedules with academics, extracurricular activities, and other commitments. This leaves them with limited time to physically meet up with friends. Online socializing provides a flexible option, allowing them to connect with others whenever and wherever they can find a spare moment in their busy lives.

In conclusion, the preference for online socializing among teenagers can be attributed to several reasons, including the convenience and instant gratification offered by digital platforms, the control over social interactions, the wider range of social connections, the sense of anonymity, and the busy nature of modern teenage life. While there may be some drawbacks to excessive online socializing, it is important to recognize and understand the underlying reasons behind this growing trend among teenagers.",STUDIES SUGGEST THAT MANY TEENAGERS THESE DAYS PREFER SOCIALISING ONLINE TO MEETING ONE ANOTHER IN PERSON.

"In recent years, the shopping mall has evolved into much more than just a place to buy groceries or clothes. With the advent of modern technology and changing consumer behavior, the purpose of shopping malls has shifted towards providing experiential entertainment. This essay will argue in favor of the statement that in the future, the main reason for going to the shopping mall will be for entertainment rather than shopping.

Firstly, the rise of e-commerce has significantly impacted traditional brick-and-mortar retail spaces. Online shopping has become increasingly popular due to its convenience and accessibility. Consumers can now satisfy their shopping needs from the comfort of their own homes, saving time and effort. As a result, the need to physically visit a shopping mall solely for shopping purposes has diminished. With a few clicks on a smartphone or computer, customers can have an array of products delivered to their doorstep. This transformation has driven shopping malls to adapt and focus more on creating compelling experiences to attract customers.

Secondly, shopping malls are increasingly diversifying their offerings to cater to changing consumer demands. Traditional department stores and retail outlets alone are no longer sufficient to draw crowds. In response, malls have started incorporating various entertainment options such as movie theaters, virtual reality zones, and indoor theme parks. These attractions serve as a magnet, pulling people towards malls for leisure and amusement rather than strictly for shopping. Therefore, it is evident that the perception of shopping malls is shifting from utilitarian spaces to entertainment hubs.

Furthermore, shopping malls are becoming social hangout spots for people of all ages. Beyond shopping, malls offer a range of dining options, cafes, and recreational activities. Individuals can gather with friends or family to enjoy a meal, catch a movie, or participate in interactive games. Shopping malls now provide a convenient and enjoyable space to spend quality time, fostering social connections and creating shared experiences. This aspect of entertainment has become a central focus for malls to attract and retain visitors in the future.

In conclusion, the notion that shopping malls of the future will primarily serve as entertainment destinations rather than shopping centers seems plausible. The emergence of e-commerce, the need for malls to diversify their offerings, and the social appeal of these spaces all contribute to this shift. The conventional purpose of malls as purely transactional spaces is steadily fading, making way for entertainment to take center stage.

Firstly, learning a foreign language at a young age can greatly enhance children's cognitive abilities. Research has shown that children who are exposed to a second language exhibit greater problem-solving skills, improved memory, and enhanced multitasking abilities. This is because learning a foreign language requires cognitive flexibility and mental agility. By introducing language learning at a primary level, children can take advantage of their natural ability to absorb information and develop these invaluable cognitive skills.

In addition to cognitive benefits, learning a foreign language at primary school also enables children to develop a broader cultural awareness. Language is not just a means of communication; it is deeply intertwined with a culture's history, values, and traditions. By learning a foreign language, children gain insights into different cultures and become more open-minded and tolerant individuals. This exposure at a young age can foster cultural empathy, promoting cross-cultural understanding and harmony in our increasingly diverse society.

Furthermore, learning a foreign language at primary school can have long-term career advantages for children. In today's global job market, employers often prioritize candidates with language skills, as it allows businesses to engage with international markets and customers more effectively. By acquiring language proficiency at a youthful age, children can achieve greater fluency and accuracy compared to those who start later in life. This linguistic advantage can open doors to a wider range of career opportunities and increase their competitiveness in the job market.

Critics argue that learning a foreign language at a young age may overload children with additional academic pressures. However, with proper pedagogical approaches, language learning can be made enjoyable and engaging, avoiding excessive stress. Incorporating interactive activities, songs, and games into language classes can foster a positive learning environment and make the language acquisition process more enjoyable for children.

In conclusion, introducing foreign language learning at primary school is not only acceptable but also highly beneficial for children. It stimulates their cognitive abilities, enhances cultural awareness, and provides them with an advantage in future careers. By offering language learning opportunities from a young age, we can help young learners become more adaptable, respectful, and successful global citizens.",IS IT ACCEPTABLE FOR CHILDREN TO LEARN FOREIGN LANGUAGE AT PRIMARY SCHOOL? ,6.0,432.0,21.0,20.571428571428573,33.0,13.0,8.476190476190476,224.0,0.2986111111111111,0.1574074074074074,0.1759259259259259,0.0254629629629629,0.0277777777777777,18.0,0.0687022900763358,5.333,0.444672131147541,434.0,168.05386955246126,0.0,0.0,168.05386955246126,14.9,16.9,16.42,4.185598472291641,0.184,0.031,0.785,55.0,0.0,0.3647540983606557,18,7,4,1.0
"Dangerous sports have always been a topic of debate. While some argue that they provide an adrenaline rush and a sense of achievement, others believe that they pose unnecessary risks to individuals. This essay will discuss both points of view and present a personal opinion on the matter.

On one hand, proponents of dangerous sports highlight the excitement and thrill associated with participating in such activities. These sports often involve physical challenges and require mental focus, which can be a source of personal satisfaction and accomplishment. The individuals who engage in dangerous sports often describe the intense emotions and the feeling of being alive that these activities provide. Additionally, these sports can promote teamwork, discipline, and other valuable life skills.

On the other hand, critics of dangerous sports argue that they place participants at needless risk. Engaging in activities such as skydiving, bungee jumping, or extreme skiing can lead to severe injuries or even death. Safety measures might be in place, but accidents can still occur. Furthermore, these sports can have long-term physical and psychological consequences for the individuals involved. The pressure to constantly push oneself to new limits can lead to a reckless mindset that overlooks safety precautions and results in tragic outcomes.

In my opinion, the view that dangerous sports should be discouraged outweighs the argument that they bring enjoyment and satisfaction. While it is true that individuals should have the freedom to pursue activities they enjoy, it is essential to prioritize their safety and well-being. The potential risks associated with participation in dangerous sports are too great to be ignored. Moreover, there are a plethora of alternative sports and activities that can provide similar levels of excitement without the same level of risk. These activities still allow individuals to challenge themselves physically and mentally while reducing the chances of severe injury or harm.

In conclusion, dangerous sports are a subject of contention, with some arguing that they offer immense enjoyment and a sense of achievement, while others emphasize the potential risks involved. While individuals should have the freedom to engage in activities they find thrilling, it is crucial to recognize the importance of safety and well-being. It is my belief that the potential dangers of dangerous sports outweigh the benefits, and alternatives should be explored to provide exhilarating experiences in a safer environment.",Discuss the view and give the opinion of dangerous sports,5.0,386.0,20.0,19.3,29.0,9.0,9.5,205.0,0.2953367875647668,0.1476683937823834,0.1139896373056994,0.038860103626943,0.0336787564766839,12.0,0.0603015075376884,5.7,0.4729411764705882,384.0,157.8718366768125,0.0,0.0,157.8718366768125,12.0,14.6,14.62,4.321302013366265,0.214,0.174,0.611,49.0,0.0,0.4470588235294118,6,3,2,1.0
"In today's busy and sedentary lifestyle, participating in sports has become more crucial than ever. It not only helps individuals maintain physical fitness but also contributes to their mental and social well-being. When it comes to choosing between team sports and individual sports, both have their benefits. However, in my opinion, team sports provide more advantages as they foster teamwork, promote social interaction, and offer opportunities for personal growth.

Firstly, team sports promote teamwork and collaboration. In a team setting, individuals learn to work together towards a common goal. They develop trust in their teammates and rely on each other for support. This promotes a sense of unity and cohesion, which translates into improved performance. Through team sports, individuals develop important life skills, such as communication, cooperation, and leadership, which are essential in a professional environment.

Secondly, team sports provide ample opportunities for social interaction. Engaging in team sports allows individuals to connect with others who share the same interests and passion for the sport. They develop lasting friendships, strengthen bonds, and create a sense of community. This social interaction not only improves one's social skills but also aids in building a strong support system, which is crucial in times of both success and failure.

Lastly, team sports present opportunities for personal growth. Being a part of a team requires individuals to push beyond their comfort zone and take on various roles and responsibilities. This encourages personal development, self-discipline, and perseverance. Additionally, individuals learn to manage conflicts, cope with pressure, and accept constructive criticism, which are essential life skills that can be applied in various aspects of life.

While individual sports also have their merits, they lack the collaborative aspect that team sports offer. Individual sports concentrate solely on an individual's performance and personal goals, with limited interaction and reliance on others. Though they promote self-motivation, discipline, and independent thinking, they often lack the social and interpersonal skills acquired through team sports.

In conclusion, team sports provide more extensive benefits compared to individual sports. The fostering of teamwork, the promotion of social interaction, and the potential for personal growth make team sports more beneficial. By participating in team sports, individuals not only develop physical fitness but also acquire vital life skills that will prove valuable in their personal and professional lives. Therefore, I believe that team sports should be prioritized when considering the physical and mental benefits of engaging in sports.",Team sports or individual sports. Which is more beneficial?

"Zoos have long been a subject of controversy, with opinions divided on whether they are cruel or useful. This essay will explore both perspectives, delving into the arguments for and against the continued existence of zoos. While some argue that zoos serve no practical purpose and inflict unnecessary harm on animals, others maintain that they play a crucial role in conservation and education. Ultimately, it is important to strike a balance that prioritizes animal welfare without undermining the broader benefits that zoos can offer.

Those who argue against zoos contend that confining animals to limited spaces is inherently cruel. They posit that the captivity in zoos disrupts animals' natural behaviors and restricts their freedom. Moreover, critics argue that animals in zoos often endure inadequate living conditions and suffer mentally and physically. The case of the infamous 'zoochosis' syndrome, where animals display repetitive, abnormal behaviors, is often cited as evidence of the detrimental effects of captivity. Additionally, skeptics assert that zoos prioritize entertainment over the well-being of animals. They believe that viewing animals in captivity for human amusement is morally wrong and should be stopped.

On the other hand, proponents of the usefulness of zoos argue that they have an important role in conservation efforts. Zoos often participate in breeding programs for endangered species, contributing to species preservation and genetic diversity. By ensuring the survival of endangered species, zoos potentially prevent their extinction. Supporters also note that zoos provide animals with veterinarian care, nutrition, and protection from predators, which they might not receive in the wild. Additionally, zoos offer an avenue for research, making it possible to study animal behavior and biology up close. This knowledge can then be applied to wildlife conservation efforts worldwide.

In addition to their conservation value, zoos also serve an educational purpose. Visitors, particularly children, can learn about different animal species, their habitats, and the importance of conservation. Zoos often organize educational programs, workshops, and presentations to help raise awareness about the threats faced by different species. Many argue that these educational experiences can foster a sense of empathy and responsibility towards the natural world. By witnessing the beauty of wildlife, visitors are more likely to champion conservation efforts, contributing to the long-term preservation of habitats.

In conclusion, the debate surrounding the usefulness or cruelty of zoos is multifaceted. While some argue against zoos due to the perceived cruelty inflicted on animals and lack of freedom, others defend their importance in conservation and education. To strike a balance, it is essential that zoos prioritize animal welfare, providing spacious enclosures, stimulation, and enrichment. Additionally, zoos should focus on their educational role, offering visitors the opportunity to learn about wildlife and the importance of conservation. By carefully considering the welfare of animals and the benefits that zoos bring to society, we can strike a harmonious balance between these two opposing viewpoints.",zoos are cruel or can be useful.

"In today's highly competitive job market, the idea of working for the same company throughout one's career has become less common. While some argue that sticking with one company can provide stability and a sense of loyalty, others believe that exploring different opportunities can lead to personal growth and a broader skill set. This essay will discuss both perspectives and present a balanced view on the matter.

On one hand, staying with the same company for an entire career has certain benefits. Firstly, it allows individuals to build a strong support network and develop meaningful relationships with colleagues. This can foster a sense of belonging and job satisfaction, as well as provide a supportive environment for professional growth. Moreover, long-term employees often gain a deep understanding of the company's operations and culture, enabling them to become highly proficient in their roles. These employees tend to be more reliable and effective in carrying out their responsibilities, as they have acquired a wealth of experience and institutional knowledge.

However, exclusively working for a single company may also have its drawbacks. One of the main disadvantages is the potential lack of exposure to different job settings and industries. This narrow experience can limit a person's perspectives and hinder their ability to adapt to changing demands in the job market. Additionally, some argue that remaining in one role may prevent individuals from developing a broader skill set, as they may become too comfortable and complacent. Exploring different opportunities, on the other hand, can expose employees to new challenges and enable them to learn diverse skills that can be transferable across various sectors.

In conclusion, the decision to work for the same company for an entire career or to explore different job opportunities is subjective and depends on individual priorities and career goals. While staying with one company can provide stability, a sense of belonging, and deep expertise, exploring different opportunities can lead to personal growth and a broader skill set.

"In the world of sports, opinions regarding the importance of mental strength and physical fitness may vary. While some argue that mental strength is crucial for success, others emphasize the significance of physical fitness. This essay will examine both perspectives and offer personal insights.

From one viewpoint, mental strength plays a pivotal role in achieving success in sports. Athletes with high levels of mental resilience display remarkable determination, focus, and the ability to cope with stress and pressure. They possess the mental fortitude to bounce back from setbacks and setbacks, making them invaluable assets to their teams. Moreover, mental strength enables athletes to develop effective strategies, improve decision-making skills, and maintain a positive attitude even in challenging situations. As a result, their enhanced mental resilience contributes to their success in sports.

On the other hand, proponents of physical fitness argue that it is the cornerstone of success in sports. Physical fitness provides athletes with the energy, endurance, strength, and agility necessary to excel in their respective fields. The demands of sports require individuals to be in peak physical condition, as it enables them to push their bodies to the limit and perform at their best. Athletes who prioritize physical fitness are less prone to injuries and can recover quicker, allowing them to sustain high-level performances consistently. Thus, physical fitness is imperative for success in sports.

While both mental strength and physical fitness are important for success in sports, the extent to which each contributes may vary depending on the sport. Sports that require precision, strategic thinking, and mental acuity, such as chess or golf, prioritize mental strength. In contrast, sports like sprinting or weightlifting place a higher emphasis on physical fitness as they rely heavily on speed, strength, and endurance. Therefore, it is vital to recognize that the significance of mental strength and physical fitness may depend on the specific requirements and demands of a particular sport.

In my personal opinion, mental strength and physical fitness are interdependent and equally crucial for success in sports. The mind and body work in tandem, and neglecting either one can hinder an athlete from reaching their full potential. Mental strength enables athletes to maintain focus, handle pressure, and overcome obstacles, while physical fitness provides them with the physical capabilities to perform at their peak. Striking a balance between the two is the key to achieving greatness in sports.

To conclude, the importance of mental strength and physical fitness in sports cannot be undermined. While opinions may vary regarding the relative significance of each, it is essential to recognize that both attributes play a vital role. Athletes who possess mental resilience and physical prowess will likely achieve remarkable success in their chosen sport. Thus, it is necessary to cultivate a harmony between mental and physical aspects to maximize one's potential in sports.",Is the mental strength important for success in sports or is it important to have strong and fit people in sports.

"There is ongoing debate regarding the most effective educational approach for young boys and girls. One perspective suggests that separate schools are a better option, while another argues that mixed schools offer greater advantages. This essay will discuss both views and present the writer's personal opinion.

Supporters of separate schools argue that a gender-specific environment allows for tailored education, addressing the unique needs of boys and girls individually. They believe that boys and girls have distinct learning styles, and separating them enables educators to employ appropriate teaching methods. For example, it is believed that girls tend to be more verbal and cooperative, while boys are often more physically active and competitive. In separate schools, teachers can design lessons and activities that cater to these specific styles, fostering a more effective learning environment.

In contrast, proponents of mixed schools argue that co-education offers numerous benefits for boys and girls. They argue that in a mixed environment, students are exposed to a wider range of perspectives, experiences, and personalities, which helps prepare them for the diverse real world they will eventually enter. Additionally, mixed schools promote gender equality, allowing boys and girls to interact on an equal footing, breaking stereotypes, and fostering mutual respect. They also suggest that in real-life situations, such as workplaces, boys and girls will need to collaborate effectively. Mixed schools thus offer an opportunity to develop these crucial skills.

In my personal opinion, both separate and mixed schools have their merits, but the advantages of mixed schools outweigh those of separate schools. Although boys and girls may have different learning styles, diverse teaching methods can be incorporated within mixed schools to accommodate these differences. Additionally, exposure to different perspectives and experiences in a mixed environment better prepares students for their future roles in society. By interacting with individuals of the opposite gender from a young age, boys and girls learn to appreciate and respect one another as equals, benefiting their personal development and fostering a harmonious coexistence in society.

In conclusion, the debate over separate schools versus mixed schools continues, with valid arguments on both sides. However, for the reasons mentioned above, it is believed that boys and girls benefit more from attending mixed schools. These institutions provide a well-rounded education and promote gender equality while preparing students for the realities of the world they will eventually navigate.","Some people think that it is better to educate boys and girls in separate schools.

"Scientists have cautioned against the excessive consumption of junk food, highlighting its detrimental effects on our health. The solution to this issue is a matter of debate, with some arguing that education is the key, while others contend that it is futile. This essay will explore both perspectives and present a reasoned opinion.

On one hand, proponents of the education approach argue that raising awareness about the dangers of junk food can empower individuals to make healthier dietary choices. By educating people about nutrition, they can develop the necessary knowledge to distinguish between nutritious and unhealthy food options. Furthermore, education can also provide individuals with the tools to understand food labels, enabling them to make informed decisions about their diet. Consequently, the dissemination of knowledge can play a critical role in curbing the excessive consumption of junk food.

On the other hand, skeptics claim that education alone is ineffective in combatting junk food consumption. They argue that although individuals may be aware of the harmful effects of junk food, they are often unable to resist the temptations and marketing strategies employed by the food industry. Junk food companies invest significant resources in advertising campaigns and promoting their products, which can easily influence consumers, overpowering their inclination to make healthy choices. In this view, education fails to address the underlying issues that contribute to the excessive consumption of junk food.

Despite the arguments against education as a solution, it is crucial to acknowledge that it plays a fundamental role in fostering healthy eating habits. Education not only increases knowledge but also builds critical thinking and decision-making skills, allowing individuals to critically assess the impact of their dietary choices on their overall health. By providing individuals with a solid understanding of nutrition, education equips them with the necessary tools to counter deceptive marketing tactics and make choices that align with their long-term well-being.

In conclusion, while some argue that education is the key to combating the excessive consumption of junk food, others claim that it is ineffective. Nevertheless, education is an essential component in addressing this issue as it empowers individuals with the knowledge and critical thinking skills necessary to make healthier dietary choices. To achieve lasting change, education should be complemented with other measures, such as regulating the food industry and promoting healthier alternatives. By taking a multifaceted approach, we can effectively combat the harmful consequences of excessive junk food consumption and improve public health.","Scientists say we eat too much junk food and that is harmful to our health.

"In recent years, the issue of whether to allocate resources towards bicycles or public transport has become a widely debated topic. While some argue that investing in bicycles can yield numerous benefits, others maintain that putting money into public transport systems is a more effective solution. This essay will discuss both perspectives and explore the advantages and drawbacks of each option.

On one hand, proponents of promoting bicycles assert that encouraging their use can have a positive impact on the environment and individuals' health. By investing in bicycle infrastructure, governments can reduce carbon emissions and air pollution, which are major contributors to climate change. Furthermore, cycling offers various health benefits, as it is a form of physical exercise that promotes cardiovascular fitness and helps individuals maintain a healthy weight. Allocating funds towards bicycle education programs and infrastructure can thus lead to a greener future and healthier citizens.

On the other hand, advocates for investing in public transport argue that this option is a more efficient and inclusive means of transportation. Public transport systems can accommodate a larger number of commuters, providing a convenient and accessible mode of travel for people of all ages and abilities. Additionally, improving and expanding public transport networks can help reduce traffic congestion, which not only saves time for individuals but also decreases fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, investing in public transport can boost the overall economy by improving connectivity between different areas and encouraging urban development.

However, it is crucial to acknowledge some limitations of both options. While bicycles are an eco-friendly mode of transport, they may not always be suitable for long distances or adverse weather conditions. Public transport, on the other hand, requires significant infrastructure investments and ongoing maintenance costs. Moreover, the effectiveness of public transport systems may be subject to the reliability and quality of service provided. It is essential to strike a balance between the two approaches and consider the specific needs and realities of each community.

In conclusion, the decision to spend money on bicycles or public transport depends on various factors. While promoting bicycles can positively impact the environment and individuals' health, investing in public transport is often seen as a more efficient and inclusive solution. Ultimately, a comprehensive approach that combines both options, tailoring the solutions to the specific needs of each community, may yield the best outcomes for sustainable and accessible transportation systems.",Discuss both view - should spend money on bicycle or public transport,5.0,398.0,19.0,20.94736842105263,29.0,11.0,9.157894736842104,228.0,0.3190954773869346,0.1532663316582914,0.1256281407035175,0.0100502512562814,0.0301507537688442,11.0,0.0488888888888888,6.053,0.4988662131519274,394.0,152.06209932446484,0.0,0.0,152.06209932446484,15.0,16.7,16.19,4.629989970113966,0.181,0.019,0.8,61.0,0.0,0.3945578231292517,4,2,2,1.0
"Public transportation is a crucial aspect of urban development, providing essential mobility options to its residents. Governments often face the dilemma of investing in upgrading existing public transport systems or constructing new railway lines specifically for very fast trains. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages, which must be carefully considered before making a decision.

One argument in favor of spending money on existing public transport is the potential to improve accessibility for a wider range of people. Upgrading existing systems can include improvements such as increasing the number of buses or trains, expanding routes, and enhancing infrastructure. This allows more individuals, including those with limited mobility, to easily access various parts of the city. Consequently, traffic congestion and pollution rates are likely to reduce as more people opt for public transportation, leading to a healthier and more sustainable urban environment.

Additionally, investing in existing public transport offers a more immediate solution to transportation challenges. Constructing new railway lines for very fast trains often requires extensive planning, land acquisitions, and construction, which can take years to complete. In contrast, upgrading existing systems can be done incrementally, ensuring that improvements are implemented as quickly as possible. This approach allows authorities to address immediate concerns and ease the burden on existing transportation networks effectively.

Moreover, investing in existing public transport can lead to a reduction in travel times and convenience for commuters. By improving the frequency and reliability of buses or trains, passengers can expect shorter waiting times. Enhanced infrastructure can also allow for faster travel speeds, resulting in reduced journey times. This is particularly beneficial for individuals who rely on public transportation for their daily commute, as it allows them to save time and have a more efficient travel experience.

On the other hand, constructing new railway lines for very fast trains offers several advantages as well. The primary benefit of high-speed trains is their ability to significantly reduce travel times between cities. This can foster economic development and promote regional connectivity. With faster transportation options, individuals and businesses can expand their activities beyond their immediate vicinity and tap into a broader range of opportunities. Consequently, this can contribute to regional growth and create employment opportunities for local communities.

Furthermore, very fast trains often operate on separate tracks, which minimizes the risk of delays caused by congestion or disruptions on existing lines. This level of efficiency ensures that passengers can rely on these trains for punctual and smooth journeys. High-speed rail networks also have the potential to alleviate road traffic congestion by providing an alternative mode of long-distance transportation. Consequently, this can lead to safer roads, decreased travel times, and increased overall productivity.

In conclusion, the decision to spend money on upgrading existing public transport or constructing new railway lines for very fast trains is a complex one. While investing in existing systems allows for improved accessibility, immediate solutions, and reduced travel times, constructing new high-speed rail networks can foster economic development and provide faster transportation options. A comprehensive evaluation of the specific needs and circumstances of each city or region is necessary to determine the most suitable course of action. Ultimately, a combination of both approaches might be the most effective strategy to provide residents with a comprehensive and efficient public transportation system.",Spending money on existing public transport or constructing new railway lines for very fast trains?,7.0,543.0,28.0,19.392857142857142,29.0,9.0,7.607142857142857,285.0,0.3149171270718232,0.1804788213627992,0.1362799263351749,0.005524861878453,0.0257826887661141,10.0,0.029940119760479,6.214,0.4451827242524916,540.0,204.0861728701981,0.0,0.0,204.0861728701981,14.4,16.8,17.23,4.680767908697608,0.158,0.027,0.815,81.0,0.0,0.3538205980066445,18,7,3,1.0
"In 2020, the downloads of social apps experienced a significant surge worldwide. This surge can be attributed to various factors such as the increasing reliance on technology, the need for connectivity, and the emergence of new social media trends. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic played a significant role in driving the downloads of selected social apps due to the increased demand for virtual communication and online socialization.

Firstly, the wide availability and accessibility of smartphones and other digital devices have contributed to the surge in social app downloads. With the advancements in technology and the decreasing costs of devices, individuals from different socio-economic backgrounds can now afford smartphones. This has opened avenues for people to explore and download various social apps to connect with others.

Secondly, the need for connectivity has become more prominent than ever before. Social apps serve as a convenient platform for individuals to interact with friends, family, and acquaintances. The ease of use and the ability to stay connected in real-time have made social apps an essential part of people's lives. Whether it is exchanging messages, sharing photos and videos, or joining interest-based communities, social apps provide an avenue for individuals to bridge the gap between physical distances.

Furthermore, the emergence of new social media trends has captivated the attention of users, resulting in increased downloads of selected social apps. Platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat have gained immense popularity, especially among the younger generation. The engaging content, filtered experiences, and creative features offered by these apps have become a source of entertainment and self-expression. As a result, users are constantly downloading these apps to keep up with the latest trends and stay connected with their peers.

Lastly, the COVID-19 pandemic undoubtedly influenced the surge in social app downloads in 2020. With lockdowns and social distancing measures in place, people turned to social apps as a means of staying connected with loved ones and combatting loneliness. The demand for virtual meeting platforms like Zoom and communication apps like WhatsApp and Messenger skyrocketed.

"There is a common belief that individuals who choose a job early in their lives and remain in the same profession are more likely to have a fulfilling career compared to those who frequently change jobs. While this perspective holds some merits, I disagree with the notion to a certain extent. Career satisfaction can be achieved through various paths, and job mobility should not be disregarded as it can lead to personal growth, skill acquisition, and increased adaptability in the ever-changing job market.

Firstly, it is important to acknowledge that committing to a single profession early on may provide stability and a sense of direction. By specializing in one field and staying in it, individuals can accrue years of experience and become experts in their respective domains. This expertise often translates into job security and the opportunity for career advancement within the same organization. Furthermore, employers may value loyalty and long-term commitment, which could lead to better job prospects and higher job satisfaction for those who follow this path.

However, frequently changing jobs can also offer immense benefits. By exploring different career options and expanding one's skill set, individuals can gain a broader perspective and become more adaptable in an ever-evolving job market. Changing jobs exposes individuals to new challenges, allowing them to acquire transferable skills and gain a more diverse range of experiences. This can enhance their employability and provide opportunities for personal and professional growth. Furthermore, switching jobs may expose individuals to different work cultures, leading to a richer set of relationships and enhancing their social and networking skills.

Moreover, frequent job changes can also result from individual dissatisfaction or the desire for better career prospects. If individuals find their current jobs unfulfilling or stagnant, changing jobs can help them seek new opportunities that align with their interests and passions. Pursuing a variety of job experiences can lead to personal satisfaction and prevent individuals from feeling trapped or unfulfilled in their careers.

In conclusion, while some argue that choosing a job early and remaining in the same profession promotes a satisfying career life, I disagree with this viewpoint to some extent. While job stability and career progression can be achieved through such a commitment, individuals should not shy away from exploring different career paths. Job mobility enables personal growth, skill acquisition, and adaptability in an ever-changing job market. Ultimately, career satisfaction can be achieved through various routes, and individuals should have the freedom to navigate their career paths based on their individual interests and goals.",Some people think that people who chose a job early and keep doing are more likely to get satisfying career life than those who frequently change jobs.TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE?,5.0,417.0,19.0,21.94736842105263,36.0,9.0,9.947368421052632,214.0,0.2997601918465228,0.2014388489208633,0.0935251798561151,0.0287769784172661,0.0431654676258992,12.0,0.0515021459227467,6.474,0.4509803921568627,417.0,159.99564375347873,0.0,0.0,159.99564375347873,14.2,16.4,15.14,4.010363184203288,0.223,0.042,0.735,63.0,0.0,0.4117647058823529,8,4,2,1.0
"In today's fast-paced society, the issue of whether children should take on extra responsibilities after school has become a topic of great interest and concern. While some argue that children should be free to enjoy their leisure time, others believe that assigning duties to children can help develop important life skills. This essay will examine both perspectives and provide a balanced analysis of the issue.

On one hand, those who advocate for children's leisure time argue that it is crucial for their overall development. They argue that after-school activities such as hobbies, sports, and spending time with friends promote social skills, creativity, and provide a much-needed break from academic pressures. By allowing children to engage in these activities, they argue that it helps foster their mental and emotional well-being, leading to a more well-rounded individual.

However, it can be argued that assigning extra responsibilities to children can play a vital role in their personal growth. By taking on additional tasks such as household chores or community service, children learn important life skills and values such as responsibility, time management, and empathy. Furthermore, these responsibilities can help children develop a strong work ethic and a sense of contribution towards their families and communities. In turn, these experiences can contribute to the development of their character and instill a sense of accomplishment and self-worth.

In addition, assigning extra responsibilities after school can also prepare children for the challenges they may face in adulthood. By participating in household tasks, children learn essential skills, including cooking, cleaning, and managing finances. These skills are not only practical for their present lives but will also be invaluable as they transition into adulthood and become independent individuals. Taking on these responsibilities also helps children develop problem-solving skills and the ability to adapt to different situations.

Nevertheless, it is important to find a balance between leisure time and responsibility. Overloading children with too many responsibilities can lead to stress and burnout, affecting their overall well-being. Therefore, parents and educators should consider age-appropriate tasks and ensure that children have enough time for relaxation, socializing, and pursuing their own interests.

In conclusion, children taking on extra responsibilities after school can have both positive and negative impacts. While leisure time allows for personal growth and self-expression, assignments of responsibilities can develop critical life skills and prepare children for adulthood. Striking a balance between the two is essential to ensure that children have opportunities for personal development and at the same time enjoy their childhood. Parents and educators should work together to ensure that children have the opportunity to engage in both leisure activities and responsibilities, enabling them to become well-rounded individuals in the future.",Should children take extra responsibilities after school?,6.0,443.0,21.0,21.09523809523809,30.0,13.0,10.19047619047619,226.0,0.327313769751693,0.1873589164785553,0.0948081264108352,0.0225733634311512,0.0361173814898419,17.0,0.0702479338842975,6.048,0.4352226720647773,450.0,183.8689839976503,0.0,0.0,183.8689839976503,13.9,16.9,16.13,4.031986166041564,0.174,0.044,0.782,77.0,0.0,0.4331983805668016,6,3,2,1.0
"In today's competitive work environment, companies often face the challenge of retaining top talent and boosting employee productivity. One method that has gained popularity is rewarding outstanding employees with extra monetary incentives. This essay will discuss the advantages and potential drawbacks of providing financial bonuses to high-performing individuals, and analyze the impact it can have on their motivation, job satisfaction, and overall performance.

There are numerous benefits associated with offering extra money to outstanding employees. Firstly, such rewards serve as a form of recognition for their hard work and contributions to the company. Employees who consistently exceed expectations and deliver exceptional results deserve to be acknowledged and rewarded accordingly. This recognition can instill a sense of pride and accomplishment, motivating them to continue excelling in their roles and encouraging others to strive for excellence as well.

Additionally, financial bonuses can lead to heightened job satisfaction among outstanding employees. Being financially rewarded for their outstanding performance not only demonstrates that their efforts are valued, but also helps to improve their financial security and stability. This can lead to a greater sense of contentment with their job and increased loyalty towards the organization. Consequently, employees are more likely to remain committed and dedicated to their tasks, resulting in improved productivity and overall company performance.

Moreover, providing extra money as a reward can have a direct impact on an employee's motivation levels. Monetary incentives act as tangible and immediate reinforcements, which can be highly effective in encouraging individuals to consistently go above and beyond their assigned duties. The promise of a bonus can act as a powerful driving force, inspiring employees to push their limits and continually seek ways to improve their performance. This heightened motivation can lead to increased productivity, innovation, and creativity, ultimately benefiting the organization as a whole.

However, it is important to consider potential drawbacks associated with the practice of rewarding outstanding employees with extra money. Firstly, it may create a sense of inequality and dissatisfaction among other employees who did not receive the same bonus. This can lead to demotivation, resentment, and a decrease in their overall performance. To mitigate this, companies could consider implementing a fair and transparent reward system that recognizes and rewards employees at different levels based on their performance and contribution.

Furthermore, relying solely on financial rewards may inadvertently lead employees to prioritize monetary gain over other aspects of their job, such as personal growth or work-life balance. This narrow focus on financial incentives can hinder the development of intrinsic motivation and may lead to a decline in overall job satisfaction. To ensure a well-rounded and motivated workforce, employers should consider complementing monetary rewards with other forms of recognition, such as career advancement opportunities, training programs, or increased autonomy in decision-making.

In conclusion, rewarding outstanding employees with extra money can be an effective strategy for boosting motivation, job satisfaction, and performance. By acknowledging and financially recognizing exceptional employees, organizations can foster a positive work environment, encourage long-term commitment, and ultimately drive success. However, it is crucial to implement a fair and transparent reward system, while also considering the potential drawbacks associated with relying solely on monetary incentives.

"In recent years, the issue of extra classes has become one of the most challenging topics in the field of education. Some argue that these additional classes are necessary for a well-rounded education, while others believe they contribute to excessive stress and an overburdened curriculum. This essay will examine both sides of the argument and present a balanced viewpoint.

On one hand, proponents of extra classes contend that they play a vital role in enhancing students' academic performance. These classes provide an opportunity for students to delve deeper into subjects they are passionate about or struggle with. For example, a student interested in mathematics could attend extra classes to further develop their skills or overcome any difficulties they may face. Additionally, these classes can help students prepare for exams and gain a competitive edge over their peers. In this way, extra classes can foster a spirit of healthy competition and motivate students to strive for excellence.

On the other hand, critics argue that the prevalence of extra classes puts undue pressure on students and disrupts their work-life balance. Many students today face overwhelming academic demands, leaving them with little time for relaxation or pursuing other non-academic interests. Attending extra classes adds to their workload and can exacerbate stress levels. Moreover, the focus on academic achievements through these classes may neglect the importance of holistic development, leaving students with limited opportunities to explore their creativity, engage in sports or other extracurricular activities, which are equally important for their overall growth.

Furthermore, the issue of accessibility to extra classes needs to be considered. While some students may have the financial means and resources to benefit from these classes, others may not. This creates an uneven playing field, where students from more affluent backgrounds have an advantage over their less privileged counterparts. This exacerbates the existing educational disparities and highlights the need for a more equitable system.

In conclusion, the debate surrounding extra classes in education is a complex one, and both sides of the argument hold valid points. It is crucial to strike a balance between the benefits they offer and the potential drawbacks they can impose. To achieve this, educators and policymakers should carefully consider the implications of extra classes on students' overall well-being and skill development, while also ensuring that they are accessible to all. Only then can extra classes become a valuable addition to the education system, rather than a burdensome affair.",Opinion on extra classes; one of the most challenging issues in education.,5.0,403.0,20.0,20.15,40.0,12.0,9.7,238.0,0.2803970223325062,0.1563275434243176,0.141439205955335,0.0223325062034739,0.0297766749379652,15.0,0.0704225352112676,5.85,0.5168539325842697,402.0,155.93562595451067,0.0,0.0,155.93562595451067,12.3,15.2,14.79,4.4134277196184,0.174,0.081,0.745,56.0,1.0,0.4359550561797752,2,1,2,1.0
"University Education Should Be Free to Everyone, Regardless of Income

University education plays a pivotal role in shaping individuals' future prospects and contributing to societal progress. However, the cost associated with higher education often creates a barrier for many aspiring students. In my opinion, university education should be accessible to all, irrespective of their income, as it promotes equal opportunities, fosters economic growth, and enhances social mobility.

Firstly, offering free university education to everyone ensures equal opportunities for all individuals. Education is a fundamental human right, and it should not be influenced by one's financial background. By eliminating tuition fees, students from low-income families would have an equal chance to pursue their desired field of study, just like their more affluent counterparts. This would create a level playing field, breaking the cycle of poverty that often perpetuates across generations.

Moreover, making university education free for everyone contributes to economic growth. Education is an essential component of a knowledge-based economy, where a highly skilled workforce drives innovation and productivity. By removing financial barriers, more individuals, regardless of their income, would be encouraged to pursue higher education. Consequently, this would lead to an increase in the number of skilled professionals in various fields, contributing to economic development and competitiveness.

Furthermore, providing free university education promotes social mobility within society. Education has long been regarded as a means of upward social mobility, offering individuals the opportunity to improve their economic and social standing. By removing financial barriers, students from disadvantaged backgrounds would have a fair chance to access higher education, thereby bridging the gap between social classes. This could lead to a more equitable and cohesive society, where individuals are not limited by their socioeconomic status.

However, it is important to acknowledge that implementing free university education might come with certain challenges. The cost associated with providing free education could place an additional burden on governments and taxpayers. In order to overcome this, alternative funding methods, such as increasing taxes on high-income individuals or seeking partnerships with private sectors, can be explored. Additionally, optimizing the allocation of resources within universities and implementing cost-saving measures can help mitigate the financial strain associated with free education.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that university education should be made free to everyone, regardless of income. By ensuring equal opportunities, promoting economic growth, and enhancing social mobility, free education would benefit both individuals and society as a whole. While challenges might arise during implementation, these can be addressed through appropriate funding strategies and efficient resource management. Ultimately, prioritizing accessible higher education is a step towards creating a fair and prosperous future for all.","UNIVERSITY EDUCATION SHOULD BE FREE TO EVERYONE, REGARDLESS OF INCOME.To what extent do you agree or disagree?",7.0,435.0,23.0,18.91304347826087,26.0,10.0,7.869565217391305,250.0,0.2758620689655172,0.1839080459770115,0.1494252873563218,0.0206896551724137,0.0390804597701149,14.0,0.054054054054054,5.652,0.4737903225806452,433.0,171.1538546405492,0.0,0.0,171.1538546405492,15.4,17.5,18.16,4.341250238788319,0.244,0.023,0.733,58.0,0.0,0.3649193548387097,2,1,2,1.0
"Nowadays, film stars and celebrities are increasingly using their public platforms to express their views on matters that extend beyond their profession. This phenomenon has stirred debates on whether it is a positive or negative development. In my opinion, I believe that this trend is predominantly positive, as it allows them to leverage their fame to bring awareness to important social issues and contribute to positive change.

Firstly, film stars and celebrities have the ability to capture the attention of large audiences due to their extensive fan base, which often consists of millions of individuals around the world. By voicing their opinions on public matters, they are able to raise awareness and ignite conversations that might have otherwise been overlooked or dismissed. This can have a profound impact on society, as their words can influence and inspire people to take action.

Furthermore, celebrities are often considered role models by many individuals, especially young fans who might look up to them. By expressing their views on public matters, these influential figures are able to shape the opinions and beliefs of their followers. This can be a positive development if the views shared align with values such as equality, justice, or environmental sustainability, as it can encourage individuals to adopt these values and work towards positive change. For example, when film stars and celebrities speak out against social injustice or advocate for climate action, it can mobilize their followers to actively support these causes.

Additionally, film stars and celebrities often have access to resources and networks that allow them to make a significant impact on public matters. Their fame and financial status can provide them with the means to fund or initiate projects that address social issues and make a difference in communities. By using their influence, they can collaborate with organizations and activists to drive change and bring attention to urgent matters such as poverty, education, or healthcare.

On the other hand, critics argue that celebrities should stick to their profession and refrain from engaging in public debates as they may not possess the necessary expertise or knowledge regarding specific issues. While this concern is valid, it is important to note that celebrities often have access to valuable resources, including advisors and experts, who can assist them in understanding complex matters and developing informed opinions. Moreover, by participating in public discussions, celebrities can contribute fresh perspectives and insights, sparking valuable conversations that lead to a more informed society.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that film stars and celebrities sharing their views on public matters beyond their profession is a predominantly positive development. By using their fame and influence, they have the power to raise awareness, inspire positive change, and mobilize their followers to support important causes. While there may be concerns about their level of expertise, their ability to access resources and collaborate with experts mitigates this issue.

"In today's highly competitive world, many children are enrolling in extra coaching classes alongside their regular school studies. This trend has sparked a debate, with some believing that these additional courses are essential for a child's future success, while others argue that the time should be dedicated to playing. In my opinion, I agree that children should prioritize their academics and take advantage of the opportunities that extra coaching classes provide.

To begin with, attending extra coaching classes can greatly benefit a child's academic performance. These classes often provide specialized guidance and support, which may not be available in a traditional school setting due to large class sizes and limited teacher-student interactions. Supplementing school studies with coaching classes can help students better understand and grasp complex concepts, leading to improved grades and overall academic performance.

Moreover, extra coaching classes can also enhance a child's critical thinking and problem-solving skills. These programs usually emphasize practical application of knowledge, encouraging students to think outside the box and approach problems from different angles. Such skills are crucial in today's dynamic and rapidly changing world, where the ability to think critically and adapt to new situations is highly valued.

Additionally, attending extra coaching classes can instill discipline and a strong work ethic in children. These classes often have strict schedules and deadlines, which help students develop time management and organizational skills. By balancing their regular school work and coaching classes, children learn valuable life skills that can benefit them not only academically but also in their future careers.

On the other hand, some argue that children need time to play and relax, and that attending extra coaching classes may hinder their social and emotional development. While it is true that playtime is crucial for a child's holistic development, it is also important to strike a balance between play and academics. With proper time management and prioritization, children can engage in both academic pursuits and recreational activities.

In conclusion, while some may argue that childhood is primarily meant for play, I believe that attending extra coaching classes alongside regular school studies is beneficial for children. These classes provide additional support, enhance critical thinking skills, and foster discipline and a strong work ethic. By striking a balance between academics and playtime, children can pave the way for a successful future.","Nowadays children are joining extra coaching classes apart from their school studies.

This essay will examine both sides of the argument and conclude that it is essential for people to respect and follow the customs and traditions of foreign places.

One reason why people should follow the customs and traditions of foreign places is to foster cultural understanding and respect. By adhering to local customs, individuals demonstrate their willingness to engage and appreciate the unique cultural heritage of the host country. This helps to bridge the gap between different cultures and promotes harmonious relationships. Moreover, by immersing themselves in the customs and traditions of a foreign place, people can gain a deeper insight into the values, beliefs, and history of the local community. This cultural empathy promotes positive cross-cultural interactions and reduces misunderstandings or stereotypes.

Furthermore, following the customs and traditions of foreign places helps individuals integrate into the local society. By embracing the local way of life, people can effectively communicate and build relationships with locals. For instance, simple gestures like greeting with a bow or observing mealtime customs can greatly contribute to creating a favorable impression with locals and help individuals feel more at home. Embracing local traditions also demonstrates a genuine interest in the community, which can lead to opportunities for growth and personal development.

However, it would be remiss not to acknowledge the potential drawbacks of blindly adhering to foreign customs and traditions. It is important to exercise a discerning attitude when faced with customs that may be discriminatory, harmful, or ethically questionable. Individuals should prioritize their values and principles and be cautious of blindly following practices that may contradict their own ethical framework. Moreover, blindly following customs without understanding or questioning them interferes with personal agency and undermines the opportunity for personal growth and critical thinking.

In conclusion, while there may be some exceptions, it is essential for people to respect and follow the customs and traditions of foreign places. Doing so promotes cultural understanding, facilitates integration into the local society, and paves the way for positive cross-cultural interactions. Nonetheless, it is equally important to be mindful of potential ethical conflicts and exercise critical thinking when faced with customs that may contradict personal values. Ultimately, striking a balance between respecting foreign customs and preserving personal autonomy will ensure a mutually enriching intercultural experience.",People should follow the customs and traditions of foreign places,5.0,434.0,21.0,20.666666666666668,30.0,12.0,9.142857142857142,224.0,0.2580645161290322,0.184331797235023,0.1474654377880184,0.0184331797235023,0.0345622119815668,14.0,0.0571428571428571,6.857,0.44375,431.0,165.1580710080045,1.0,-0.0101620886378751,165.1479089193666,14.9,17.2,16.88,4.312761800447109,0.213,0.05,0.737,69.0,0.0,0.4,40,14,7,1.0
"Science plays a vital role in shaping our world and has contributed significantly to improving people's lives. However, there are differing opinions on whether the primary aim of science should be solely focused on improving people's lives. In this essay, I will argue that while enhancing human well-being is undoubtedly an important goal of science, it should not be its sole purpose.

Firstly, it is crucial to acknowledge that science has undeniably brought about numerous advancements that have positively impacted people's lives. Medical breakthroughs, for instance, have revolutionized healthcare, enhancing the quality and length of human lives. From the development of vaccines to the discovery of antibiotics, these scientific achievements have helped eradicate deadly diseases and reduce human suffering. Additionally, scientific advancements in the field of agriculture have significantly improved food production and reduced hunger globally. These examples demonstrate how science can directly and specifically contribute to improving the lives of individuals.

However, it would be shortsighted to limit the purpose of science solely to improving people's lives. Science should also be aimed at broadening our understanding of the natural world and pushing the boundaries of human knowledge. The pursuit of knowledge for its own sake has led to remarkable discoveries that may not have an immediate impact on human well-being but are invaluable in expanding our understanding of the universe. Scientific research in fields such as astrophysics or particle physics may not have an immediate practical application, but it contributes to our collective knowledge and fuels further scientific inquiry.

Moreover, science should not be confined only to addressing the needs of the present and improving current living conditions. It should have a forward-thinking approach, anticipating future challenges and exploring potential solutions. By investing in scientific research that focuses on long-term sustainability and environmental preservation, we can ensure the well-being of future generations. Science should not only aim to improve people's lives in the present, but it should also work towards creating a sustainable and habitable planet for future inhabitants.

In addition, science should not be solely driven by the aim of improving lives but should also prioritize ethical considerations and potential risks involved. For instance, advancements in genetic engineering have the potential to cure genetic diseases and improve human lives, but they also raise ethical concerns and questions about altering the natural order. Therefore, science should not neglect the importance of ethics and must consider the potential consequences and risks before proceeding.

In conclusion, while improving people's lives is undoubtedly an essential aim of science, it should not be its sole purpose. Science should also strive to expand human knowledge, anticipate future challenges, and prioritize ethical considerations. By embracing a holistic approach to science, we can ensure progress that not only benefits individuals in the present but also contributes to the long-term sustainability and well-being of humanity as a whole.",THE MOST IMPORTANT AIM OF SCIENCE SHOULD BE TO IMPROVE PEOPLE'S LIVES.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,6.0,471.0,22.0,21.40909090909091,33.0,13.0,10.590909090909092,232.0,0.2760084925690021,0.1740976645435244,0.1146496815286624,0.0254777070063694,0.0424628450106157,10.0,0.0398406374501992,6.182,0.4282982791586998,476.0,199.9626384705048,2.0,-0.0548286968157213,199.90780977368908,14.0,16.9,16.01,4.381584120338816,0.156,0.03,0.814,70.0,1.0,0.4455066921606118,14,7,2,1.0
"Some people argue that a significant portion of household waste is not recycled and, therefore, suggest that governments should enforce recycling as a legal requirement. This essay will explore the extent to which laws are needed to encourage individuals to recycle more effectively.

To begin with, it is undeniable that recycling has become increasingly important due to the growing environmental concerns surrounding waste management. While some individuals voluntarily choose to recycle, many others still dispose of their waste improperly. This is especially true in regions where recycling infrastructure is lacking or inaccessible. In such cases, legal requirements can play a crucial role in ensuring the proper disposal and recycling of waste.

Imposing recycling laws can have a positive impact by creating a sense of obligation among individuals. When recycling is mandated by law, it becomes a norm and part of everyday life. People are more likely to comply with recycling obligations if they are aware that everyone around them is doing the same. Legal requirements can help shift public attitudes towards recycling and create a collective commitment to preserving the environment for future generations.

Furthermore, laws can provide incentives and clearly define the consequences for non-compliance. For example, governments can offer tax benefits or reduced waste management fees to households that demonstrate efficient recycling practices. On the other hand, individuals who fail to comply with recycling regulations can face penalties or fines. By implementing such measures, governments can ensure that recycling becomes a cost-effective and desirable option for households.

However, while legal requirements can encourage individuals to recycle, they should be accompanied by effective education and awareness programs. Providing information on the benefits of recycling, the proper procedures, and the impact of improper waste disposal is essential for sustaining long-term behavioral changes. Laws alone cannot guarantee widespread compliance; they need to be supported by comprehensive environmental campaigns and educational initiatives.

In conclusion, laws can play a significant role in increasing recycling rates by creating an atmosphere of responsibility and obligation. They can contribute to changing public attitudes and behaviors, serving as a forceful catalyst for sustainable waste management practices. However, it is crucial that legislation is accompanied by education and awareness programs to ensure a comprehensive approach in promoting recycling. Ultimately, a combination of legal requirements and well-rounded initiatives is necessary to encourage people to recycle more effectively.",SOME PEOPLE CLAIM THAT NOT ENOUGH OF THE WASTE FROM HOMES IS RECYCLED.They say that the only way to increase recycling is for governments to make it a legal requirement.To what extent do you think laws are needed to make people recycle more of their waste?,6.0,388.0,21.0,18.476190476190474,25.0,12.0,8.333333333333334,224.0,0.2938144329896907,0.190721649484536,0.1211340206185567,0.0257731958762886,0.0360824742268041,14.0,0.0642201834862385,5.619,0.4988344988344988,387.0,150.59294287052393,0.0,0.0,150.59294287052393,14.0,16.2,17.06,4.281419377401842,0.205,0.068,0.727,52.0,0.0,0.4079254079254079,0,0,1,1.0
"In today's fast-paced and competitive world, working extended hours has become a common phenomenon. While some argue that this practice should be encouraged to meet the demands of a growing economy, I firmly believe that working extended hours should be restricted. This essay will discuss the negative impact of working long hours on individuals' physical and mental health, work-life balance, and productivity.

Firstly, working extended hours takes a toll on individuals' physical and mental health. Prolonged periods of work without sufficient breaks can lead to fatigue, stress, and burnout. Research has shown that individuals who work long hours have an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, mental illnesses, and musculoskeletal disorders. These health issues not only negatively impact individuals' quality of life but also result in increased healthcare costs for employers and society as a whole.

Secondly, working long hours has a detrimental effect on individuals' work-life balance. When employees are consistently overworked and have little time for leisure activities, hobbies, or spending time with family and friends, their overall well-being is compromised. This can lead to strained relationships, decreased job satisfaction, and a higher probability of experiencing work-related conflicts. Ultimately, a poor work-life balance can contribute to decreased productivity and motivation among employees.

Furthermore, working extended hours does not necessarily result in increased productivity. Numerous studies have shown that long working hours often lead to decreased concentration and effectiveness. When individuals are fatigued, their ability to make sound judgments and creative decisions diminishes. Additionally, working long hours can lead to tasks being rushed or completed hastily, resulting in potential errors and decreased overall efficiency.

Moreover, restricting extended working hours can lead to a more equitable distribution of work opportunities. In many cases, individuals who work extended hours are often compensated with overtime pay or additional bonuses. This puts those who are unable or unwilling to work long hours at a disadvantage. By limiting the number of hours employees are compelled to work, employers are encouraged to hire additional staff, creating more job opportunities and reducing unemployment rates.

In conclusion, while some argue that working extended hours should be encouraged to meet the demands of a growing economy, the negative impact on individuals' physical and mental health, work-life balance, and productivity cannot be ignored. Therefore, it is imperative that governments, employers, and individuals work together to restrict extended working hours. By doing so, we can ensure a healthier and more balanced society that values the well-being of its workforce.",Working Extended hours should restricted.,6.0,409.0,22.0,18.59090909090909,36.0,11.0,7.636363636363637,217.0,0.3056234718826406,0.2053789731051344,0.1222493887530562,0.0146699266503667,0.0268948655256723,15.0,0.0597609561752988,5.636,0.4446808510638297,413.0,166.95677395275607,0.0,0.0,166.95677395275607,14.1,16.0,16.42,4.352591552433682,0.143,0.114,0.743,52.0,0.0,0.3574468085106383,34,16,3,1.0
"In recent years, there has been a growing debate about the role of universities in teaching arts subjects. Some argue that universities should not focus on arts subjects, while others believe that arts subjects have a valuable place in higher education. From my perspective, I strongly disagree with the notion that universities should abandon the teaching of arts subjects. This essay will explore the benefits of arts education and explain why it should remain an integral part of university curricula.

To begin with, arts subjects provide students with a well-rounded education. While technical and scientific knowledge is undoubtedly important, arts subjects enable students to develop critical thinking skills, creativity, and emotional intelligence. These skills are essential for success in any field and are not adequately addressed within the domains of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). By immersing themselves in arts subjects, students are exposed to diverse perspectives, ideas, and cultures, which ultimately enhances their ability to think independently and solve problems creatively.

Furthermore, the arts play a vital role in fostering cultural understanding and appreciation. Universities are crucial institutions for promoting diversity and inclusivity, and arts subjects are instrumental in achieving these goals. By studying arts subjects, students gain insights into different cultures, traditions, and historical contexts. This broadens their horizons and promotes empathy and respect for diverse communities. With today's globalized world becoming increasingly interconnected, it is imperative that universities equip students with the knowledge and understanding to navigate complex cultural landscapes.

Moreover, arts education contributes significantly to personal development. Many students enter university unsure of their passions and career paths. By exploring various arts subjects, students gain a better understanding of their interests, talents, and potential career choices. The arts provide a platform for self-expression and personal growth, offering students the opportunity to discover and develop their unique skills and abilities. This self-discovery ultimately leads to personal fulfillment and fosters a sense of identity and purpose beyond mere academic achievements.

On the other hand, critics argue that arts subjects do not lead directly to job prospects or financial stability, making them less valuable in an increasingly competitive job market. However, this perspective fails to acknowledge that arts graduates possess essential transferable skills that are highly sought after by employers. Critical thinking, effective communication, adaptability, and creativity are attributes that are valuable across all industries. Employers today recognize the importance of a well-rounded employee who can think critically and innovatively to navigate constantly evolving work environments.

In conclusion, it would be misguided for universities to disregard the teaching of arts subjects. Arts education provides a well-rounded education, promotes cultural understanding, and contributes to personal development. Furthermore, the skills acquired through arts subjects are highly transferable and valuable in the job market. As such, universities should continue to prioritize and invest in arts education to ensure the holistic development of their students and to prepare them for the complexities of the modern world.","Universities should not teach arts subjects, agree or disagree?",6.0,484.0,26.0,18.615384615384617,31.0,8.0,7.615384615384615,274.0,0.3409090909090909,0.1446280991735537,0.1074380165289256,0.018595041322314,0.0144628099173553,19.0,0.0650684931506849,6.038,0.4845173041894353,484.0,183.20745920680764,0.0,0.0,183.20745920680764,14.1,17.1,17.87,4.475761574458321,0.181,0.051,0.769,69.0,1.0,0.360655737704918,2,1,2,1.0
"In today's fast-paced world, the role of women has evolved significantly. Many mothers now actively seek employment outside of the home, which has led to an ongoing debate about whether this choice is detrimental to their children. This essay will argue that while there may be challenges associated with working mothers, the benefits they bring far outweigh any negative impacts on young people.

To begin with, it is important to acknowledge the potential problems that working mothers can present for young people. One possible issue is the lack of time mothers may have to spend with their children due to work commitments. Children, especially at a young age, need substantial attention and nurturing to develop emotionally and intellectually. If their mother is constantly tied up with her job, there is a risk of them feeling neglected or isolated, leading to potential behavioral and emotional problems.

Additionally, working mothers often face difficulties in maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Juggling both family responsibilities and professional commitments can be physically and mentally exhausting, leaving them with little energy to engage in quality time with their children. This could potentially hinder their ability to develop strong bonds, which are crucial for a child's overall well-being.

Nonetheless, it is crucial to emphasize that the advantages of having working mothers far outweigh the drawbacks. Firstly, a mother's decision to work can serve as a powerful role model for her children, both boys and girls. Witnessing their mother's dedication to her career can inspire young people to strive for their own goals and ambitions, instilling in them the belief that they too can succeed in various spheres of life.

Secondly, when a mother works outside the home, it often leads to financial stability, which positively impacts the family as a whole. This stability ensures access to better healthcare, education, and overall improvements in the child's standard of living. It also provides them with opportunities to explore their passions and interests by enrolling in extracurricular activities or attending specialized courses, thus broadening their horizons and nurturing their talents.

Furthermore, the presence of working mothers can result in a more egalitarian division of labor within the household. Children growing up in families where both parents take active roles in child-rearing and household chores are more likely to develop a sense of equality and respect in relationships. This balanced upbringing helps young people to build healthier and more fulfilling relationships in their own lives.

In conclusion, while it is true that having working mothers can introduce some unique challenges for young people, the benefits they bring far surpass any negative impacts. The opportunities for personal growth, financial stability, and a more balanced familial environment that they provide outweigh the possible issues related to lack of time and attention. It is, therefore, imperative to recognize the value that working mothers bring to the lives of their children, as well as to society as a whole.","Working mothers cause the problems young people, agree or disagree?",7.0,484.0,22.0,22.0,34.0,11.0,10.590909090909092,268.0,0.268595041322314,0.1632231404958677,0.1033057851239669,0.0330578512396694,0.0227272727272727,9.0,0.0346153846153846,6.682,0.4703703703703704,486.0,198.30258309712343,0.0,0.0,198.30258309712343,13.1,15.5,13.92,4.635769123313596,0.173,0.059,0.768,64.0,1.0,0.4314814814814814,2,1,2,1.0
"Education plays a significant role in shaping the future of young individuals. While some argue that all young people should pursue full-time education until they reach 18 years old, I hold a diverging opinion. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages of extending education until the age of 18, as well as the potential drawbacks of this approach. Ultimately, I believe that the decision to continue education should be made on an individual basis, taking into account personal aspirations and career objectives.

On one hand, proponents of mandatory full-time education until the age of 18 argue that it prepares young people with the necessary knowledge and skills to thrive in an increasingly competitive world. Advanced subjects and comprehensive curricula offered in schools provide students with a solid foundation for their future careers. Furthermore, remaining in full-time education until the age of 18 can significantly boost employment prospects, as most entry-level positions nowadays require a minimum level of education.

Another advantage of full-time education until the age of 18 is the opportunity for personal development. Education not only imparts academic knowledge, but also instills important life skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and effective communication. These skills are crucial for success in any field and are best acquired during one's formative years. Additionally, longer periods of education may encourage young individuals to explore various subjects and disciplines, allowing them to discover their passions and interests before making important career decisions.

However, several concerns arise when considering compulsory full-time education until the age of 18. First and foremost, not all young people may benefit from an extended period of education. Some individuals may possess vocational skills or talents from an early age, which can be honed through specialized vocational training or apprenticeships rather than a traditional academic curriculum. Forcing them to remain in full-time education may hinder their growth and delay their professional development.

Moreover, prolonging compulsory education could place an unnecessary financial burden on both individuals and society. Students and their families would have to bear the costs associated with additional years of education, including fees, supplies, and living expenses. Furthermore, governments would need to allocate more resources towards expanding educational infrastructure and recruiting additional teaching staff. Such financial strain may not be feasible in all regions, especially in developing countries or areas with limited resources.

In conclusion, while full-time education until the age of 18 offers undeniable benefits in terms of knowledge acquisition and personal development, it is important to recognize that not all young people may thrive in a traditional academic setting. The decision to continue education should be made on an individual basis, taking into account personal aspirations and career objectives.

"In recent years, concern for the environment has become a global priority. Some argue that individuals are powerless to make a difference in improving the environment, believing that only large companies and businesses have the capability to create meaningful change. I vehemently disagree with this notion, as I am of the opinion that every individual can contribute to improving the environment in their own capacity. This essay will discuss how individuals can make a positive impact on the environment through their choices and actions.

Firstly, it is crucial to recognize that the actions of individuals collectively have a significant impact on the environment. Small, everyday choices such as using public transportation, conserving energy, and reducing waste can make a substantial difference. For instance, if more individuals opt for carpooling or utilizing public transport instead of driving, there would be a marked reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Similarly, each individual's decision to limit their energy consumption and embrace renewable energy sources can contribute to mitigating climate change. Therefore, individual efforts should not be undermined, as they can lead to immense positive change.

Furthermore, individuals hold the power of consumer choices. By supporting eco-friendly products and environmentally conscious companies, individuals can exert pressure on businesses to prioritize sustainability and reduce their environmental footprint. The popularity of organic and plant-based food items, for example, has prompted many food manufacturers to adopt more sustainable agricultural practices. Additionally, individuals advocating for the use of renewable energy sources through their purchasing decisions can shape the energy industry towards cleaner alternatives. Thus, it is evident that individual choices as consumers do have the potential to direct the behavior of large companies and businesses.

Moreover, individuals can play an active role in raising awareness and promoting environmentally friendly practices within their communities. By organizing events, participating in local initiatives, and educating others about the importance of environmental protection, individuals can inspire change on a larger scale. Grassroots movements led by individuals have historically played a critical role in various environmental issues, such as waste management and conservation programs. Therefore, it is crucial to acknowledge the power of individuals to mobilize their communities and garner support for sustainable practices.

Admittedly, large companies and businesses wield considerable influence and resources that can impact the environment on a significant scale. However, it would be unjust to believe that individuals are helpless in the face of environmental challenges. By taking personal responsibility and making conscious choices, individuals can create a ripple effect that inspires others and leads to collective change.

In conclusion, while it is true that large companies and businesses have the potential to impact the environment significantly, I firmly believe that individuals can also make a difference. Through their choices as consumers, their efforts in raising awareness, and their commitment to sustainable practices, individuals play a crucial role in improving the environment. Therefore, it is essential to recognize and harness the power and potential of individuals to create a sustainable future for generations to come.",Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment.

"Under British and Australian laws, a jury in a criminal case is not granted access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This practice is in place to protect the person being accused of the crime. However, some lawyers argue that this should be changed and that juries should be given all past facts before reaching their decision. In this essay, I will argue in favor of maintaining the current practice, as it upholds principles of fairness and ensures a just trial.

The current restriction preventing juries from accessing a defendant's past criminal record is rooted in the belief that a defendant should be tried solely for the crime at hand, without any prejudice based on previous convictions. By not disclosing a person's prior criminal history, the jury can evaluate the evidence presented in the case without bias. This allows for a more objective assessment and decision-making process.

Moreover, it is essential to consider the importance of maintaining privacy and the presumption of innocence until proven guilty. Revealing a defendant's past criminal record to a jury could jeopardize their right to a fair trial. If juries were privy to this information, there is a risk that it could influence their perception of guilt, leading to potential wrongful convictions based on past behavior rather than the presented evidence.

Additionally, allowing juries access to a defendant's prior criminal record could undermine the role of other legal professionals involved in the trial. The judge and defense lawyers are responsible for presenting evidence and arguments to support or challenge the charges. Granting jurors access to the defendant's past criminal history might inadvertently diminish the role of the defense lawyer, as their primary task is to represent their client's best interests irrespective of their previous record.

It is worth noting that the current practice does not prevent the prosecution from presenting evidence of a defendant's past criminal activity, provided that it is directly relevant to the case being tried. This ensures a fair balance between protecting the defendant's rights and allowing relevant evidence to be presented in court, ensuring a fair and objective judicial process.

In conclusion, maintaining the current practice of not disclosing a defendant's past criminal record to juries is essential for upholding fundamental principles of a fair trial. Granting access to this information could lead to biased decision-making, jeopardize privacy, and undermine the role of the defense lawyer. By preserving the integrity of the trial process, we can guarantee that justice is served based on concrete evidence and not influenced by irrelevant or prejudiced factors.",Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record.

"In recent years, there has been an increasing emphasis on the prevention of health problems and illnesses, with proponents arguing that it is more important than treatment and medicine. Consequently, there are calls for government funding to be reallocated to reflect this priority. While I agree that prevention plays a crucial role in public health, I believe that a balance between prevention and treatment should be maintained.

Undoubtedly, prevention is a key aspect in maintaining a healthy society. By focusing on preventative measures, such as regular exercise, healthy eating, and immunizations, we can reduce the occurrence of various health conditions. Investing in preventive healthcare is particularly effective in combating non-communicable diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. For instance, promoting awareness campaigns to encourage physical activity and the consumption of a balanced diet would significantly reduce the prevalence of obesity, a major contributing factor to various health problems.

Moreover, prevention not only enhances individuals' well-being but also contributes to the overall sustainability of healthcare systems. Allocating resources towards preventive measures reduces the burden on hospitals and medical facilities, ultimately saving costs. Additionally, focusing on prevention can help optimize the allocation of resources by directing them towards proactive measures rather than reactive treatments. This shift in approach could lead to improved health outcomes and a more efficient use of available resources.

However, it is important to recognize that treatment and medicine remain vital in addressing existing health conditions. Despite the success of preventative actions, individuals may still fall ill due to genetic factors, accidents, or unforeseen circumstances. For instance, a person with a hereditary cancer risk would benefit from regular check-ups and early detection measures, which can lead to effective treatment or management of the condition. Furthermore, there are certain diseases, such as infections or acute injuries, where immediate medical intervention is necessary to prevent further complications or even death. Neglecting treatment in favor of prevention alone could potentially leave individuals stranded in cases where medical intervention is essential.

Thus, instead of focusing solely on prevention or treatment, a comprehensive approach is required. Government funding should be allocated strategically to address both aspects of healthcare. While a substantial portion of the budget should go towards preventative measures, there should still be sufficient funds dedicated to treatment and medicine. A balanced approach ensures that both proactive and reactive healthcare services are adequately supported, creating a more resilient and effective healthcare system.

In conclusion, while the prevention of health problems and illnesses is undeniably significant, it should not overshadow the importance of treatment and medicine. Government funding should be reflective of both aspects, as a comprehensive approach that integrates prevention and treatment is crucial in promoting public health. By striking a balance between prevention and treatment, society can maximize the overall wellbeing of its citizens and ensure the sustainability of healthcare systems.",The prevention of health problems and illness is more important than treatment and medicine.

"Television has become a prevalent form of entertainment in today's society, dominating the free time of an increasing number of individuals. However, some argue that excessive television consumption can lead to laziness and hinder social interactions with others. I strongly agree with this view, as television can become a primary source of leisure, causing individuals to neglect important aspects of their lives.

Firstly, the passive nature of watching television encourages sedentary behavior and can contribute to physical inactivity. When people spend long hours sitting in front of the television, they are not engaging in physical activities such as exercising, playing sports or even taking a leisurely walk. This sedentary lifestyle can lead to various health issues, including obesity, cardiovascular problems, and muscular atrophy.

Moreover, excessive television viewing can negatively impact social interactions. Instead of spending free time socializing with family, friends, or participating in outdoor activities, individuals may choose to isolate themselves at home, glued to their screens. As a result, they become disconnected from real-life experiences, missing out on forming meaningful relationships and developing essential social skills. Social interactions are vital for personal growth, emotional well-being, and building a strong support network.

Additionally, television can cultivate a passive mindset, limiting critical thinking and creativity. It often presents a distorted version of reality, where individuals are continuously exposed to fictional narratives, stereotypes, and exaggerated ideals. This can hinder individuals' ability to think critically and discern between fact and fiction. Instead of actively engaging their minds through reading, writing, or participating in stimulating discussions, excessive TV viewers may simply accept the information presented to them without question.

Furthermore, the constant availability of television shows and programs can lead to addictive behavior. With countless channels and online streaming platforms, individuals can easily get caught in a never-ending cycle of binge-watching. This addiction can deteriorate productivity, interfering with work, studies, and other important responsibilities. Additionally, excessive television consumption can disrupt sleep patterns and lead to sleep deprivation, further exacerbating problems such as lack of focus and reduced productivity.

In conclusion, television has become a dominant force in many people's lives, consuming a significant portion of their free time. However, the negative consequences of excessive television viewing, such as laziness and isolation from social interactions, should not be overlooked. It is crucial for individuals to strike a balance between leisure activities, ensuring that television does not overshadow other important aspects of life. By limiting television time, one can make room for more enriching experiences, allowing for personal growth, improved physical well-being, and positive social interactions.",TELEVISION DOMINATES THE FREE-TIME OF TOO MANY PEOPLE.

"Road safety is a significant concern worldwide, and many strategies have been proposed to address this issue. One particularly controversial approach is to impose harsher penalties for driving offenses as the primary means to improve safety on our roads. While there are merits to this perspective, I believe that it is not the only solution, and other measures should also be considered and implemented.

To begin with, stricter punishments for driving offenses can play a pivotal role in discouraging reckless driving behavior. Increased fines, license suspensions, or even incarceration can serve as strong deterrents to individuals who might otherwise engage in dangerous driving habits. A driver who knows that there are severe consequences for speeding, drunk driving, or disobeying traffic rules is more likely to abide by regulations, ultimately leading to safer roads for all.

Moreover, stricter punishments can potentially instill a greater sense of responsibility among drivers, as they become aware of the grave consequences of their actions. Knowing that their behavior behind the wheel can have life-altering ramifications, individuals may be more inclined to adopt cautious driving habits and prioritize the safety of themselves and others. This increased accountability could result in a significant reduction in accidents and casualties on the roads.

However, relying solely on harsher penalties for driving offenses has its limitations. Firstly, it is essential to recognize that not all traffic violations are intentional or the result of reckless behavior. In some cases, individuals may unknowingly violate traffic laws due to unfamiliarity with the rules or lack of awareness. In such instances, employing alternative measures to educate drivers about road safety, such as mandatory driver education programs or initiatives promoting knowledge of traffic regulations, might be more effective in preventing accidents.

Moreover, it is crucial to address the root causes of risky driving behaviors rather than solely focusing on punitive measures. Factors such as inadequate infrastructure, lack of road signs, and poor traffic management can contribute significantly to accidents. By investing in improving these aspects, authorities can create a safer driving environment and reduce the occurrence of traffic offenses. Additionally, promoting awareness campaigns about road safety and raising public consciousness on the importance of responsible driving can complement strict punishments and create a lasting impact.

In conclusion, while stricter punishments for driving offenses can enhance road safety by acting as potent deterrents and promoting a sense of accountability, I believe that they are not the sole solution to this issue. Alternative approaches such as driver education programs, infrastructure improvements, and awareness campaigns should also be emphasized to complement the effect of stricter penalties. By adopting a multifaceted approach, we can strive to improve safety on our roads and protect the lives of drivers and pedestrians alike.",The only way to improve safety on our roads is to give much stricter punishments for driving offences.

"In modern society, it is widely agreed that government plays a crucial role in assisting disadvantaged individuals. This essay will discuss the reasons why governments should provide support to these people, focusing on their access to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities.

First and foremost, governments should be responsible for ensuring equal access to education for all citizens, regardless of their economic background. Education is the cornerstone of personal development and a pathway to success. However, disadvantaged individuals often face numerous barriers in accessing quality education, such as lack of financial resources or inadequate learning facilities. By providing financial aid, scholarships, and improved infrastructure, governments can ensure that no one is left behind and that all individuals have an equal chance of attaining their educational goals.

Furthermore, governments should also provide assistance in the form of healthcare to disadvantaged people. Access to proper healthcare is a fundamental human right, yet many disadvantaged individuals struggle to afford medical treatment or lack adequate healthcare facilities in their communities. By implementing affordable or free healthcare programs, governments can help guarantee that everyone receives the medical attention they need, promoting a healthier society as a whole.

Additionally, governments should play a pivotal role in creating employment opportunities for disadvantaged individuals. Unemployment and underemployment disproportionately affect those who are economically disadvantaged, leading to a cycle of poverty and social exclusion. By implementing job training programs, promoting entrepreneurship, and offering incentives to businesses to hire disadvantaged individuals, governments can break this cycle and empower individuals to achieve financial independence.

Moreover, by assisting disadvantaged individuals, governments contribute to the overall social stability and cohesion within a nation. When a significant portion of the population is left behind and restricted from reaching their full potential, it can lead to social unrest and inequality. By providing support to these individuals, governments ensure a fair and just society, where all citizens have equal opportunities for growth and advancement. This, in turn, fosters a sense of belonging and solidarity among the population.

In conclusion, it is evident that governments should assist disadvantaged people in various aspects of their lives. By focusing on their access to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities, governments can empower these individuals to overcome their disadvantages and contribute positively to society. It is crucial for governments to prioritize the welfare of all their citizens and strive for a more inclusive and equal society.",Government should assist disadvantaged people.,6.0,394.0,19.0,20.73684210526316,30.0,12.0,9.105263157894736,214.0,0.3071065989847715,0.1573604060913705,0.1192893401015228,0.0177664974619289,0.0279187817258883,12.0,0.0542986425339366,6.684,0.4527027027027027,387.0,152.640452588529,1.0,-0.0087078590673132,152.6317447294617,16.1,18.3,18.16,4.320214852561781,0.162,0.109,0.729,56.0,0.0,0.3896396396396396,12,6,2,1.0
"In recent times, there has been a growing emphasis on promoting vocational training as an alternative to traditional higher education. While some argue that vocational training is not as valuable as pursuing a college degree, I strongly believe that more people should be encouraged to undertake vocational training. This essay will examine the benefits of vocational training, including its practicality, job prospects, and potential for personal fulfillment.

To begin with, vocational training provides individuals with practical skills that are highly relevant in the job market. Unlike theoretical knowledge acquired through a college degree, vocational training offers hands-on experience and specialized skills in specific industries. For instance, individuals who receive training in fields such as plumbing, electrician work, or hairstyling gain practical expertise and can apply these skills immediately in their respective careers. This leads to increased job readiness and competitiveness in the workforce.

Moreover, vocational training often leads to better job prospects and financial stability. With the rapid changes in the job market and advancements in technology, there is a growing demand for skilled workers in various sectors. Many vocational occupations, such as healthcare, information technology, and the skilled trades, offer high-paying jobs and stable career paths. It is worth noting that individuals with vocational training often have better employment outcomes compared to those with general degrees, as they possess specialized skills that are in demand. Encouraging more people to pursue vocational training would help bridge the gap between the skills required by employers and the skills possessed by job seekers.

Furthermore, vocational training can provide individuals with a sense of personal fulfillment and empowerment. Many people find satisfaction and pride in their ability to contribute to society through their skills and expertise. Vocational training enables individuals to carve out a niche for themselves in the job market, leading to increased job satisfaction and a sense of accomplishment. By promoting vocational training, societies can celebrate and support the diverse range of talents and expertise that individuals possess.

On the other hand, critics argue that vocational training may limit individuals' intellectual growth and limit their opportunities for upward mobility. They believe that a college degree offers a broader education and the ability to pursue various career paths. However, it is important to recognize that vocational training does not restrict individuals from seeking further education or career advancement. Many vocational training programs offer opportunities for individuals to continue their education and obtain higher qualifications in their respective fields. Additionally, with the changing nature and requirements of the job market, individuals can benefit from the flexibility and adaptability that vocational training equips them with.

In conclusion, the benefits of vocational training outweigh the perceived drawbacks. By encouraging more people to undertake vocational training, societies can equip individuals with practical skills, increase job prospects, and promote personal fulfillment.

It is evident that exposure to pollution in big cities can be harmful to health.

Furthermore, big cities tend to have a fast-paced and stressful lifestyle. The pressures of work, long commuting hours, and the constant hustle and bustle can lead to chronic stress. Stress is known to have adverse effects on mental and physical health, including increased risk of heart disease, depression, and anxiety. The high cost of living in urban areas can also create financial stress, which can further impact well-being. Hence, living in a big city can potentially take a toll on an individual's health due to the stressful environment.

However, it is important to acknowledge that big cities also offer numerous opportunities to lead a healthy lifestyle. Despite the challenges, there are extensive recreational and fitness facilities available in urban areas. Parks, gyms, and sports clubs provide easy access to exercise and outdoor activities. Big cities also tend to prioritize public health initiatives, with initiatives such as bike-sharing programs and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, encouraging physical activity.

Moreover, big cities are often equipped with world-class healthcare facilities. Urban areas attract well-trained medical professionals and offer a wide range of specialized healthcare services. This accessibility to quality healthcare can positively impact health outcomes and ensure timely medical intervention when needed. In addition, cities often host health awareness campaigns, screenings, and vaccination drives, which contribute to promoting overall well-being.

Finally, big cities also tend to offer a wider range of food options compared to rural areas. With a growing trend toward health-conscious eating, urban hubs typically have a variety of restaurants and supermarkets that cater to diverse dietary preferences. This availability of nutritious food choices can contribute to the adoption of a healthier lifestyle.

"In recent years, the topic of preserving old buildings versus replacing them with modern structures has sparked a heated debate. Some individuals argue for the demolition of aged edifices in favor of new ones, while others believe that old buildings hold historical and cultural significance that should be safeguarded. While I acknowledge the benefits of progress and development, I firmly disagree with the notion that old buildings should be destroyed and replaced entirely.

Old buildings serve as a connection to our collective past, providing tangible links to our cultural heritage. They offer a glimpse into the architectural styles, craftsmanship, and social values of bygone eras. For instance, historical landmarks such as castles, palaces, and temples not only represent a country or community's history, but also attract tourists, stimulating local economies. These structures serve as living museums, allowing future generations to appreciate the beauty and intricacy of the past.

Furthermore, old buildings contribute to the unique charm and character of a city or town. Their architectural diversity offers a visual narrative of the region's history and helps establish a sense of identity. Preserving old buildings can foster a sense of local pride and community cohesion. In contrast, demolishing them in favor of generic modern structures can lead to the erasure of cultural distinctiveness, replacing it with homogeneity.

Moreover, converting old buildings for contemporary uses can be a cost-effective and sustainable solution. Rather than demolishing them, adaptive reuse can breathe new life into these structures while retaining their original charm. By repurposing old buildings for offices, museums, or residential spaces, we reduce waste and promote sustainability, as modern construction often requires substantial amounts of energy and resources.

It is important to acknowledge that progress and modernization are inevitable. Cities need to adapt to evolving needs and requirements. However, this does not necessitate the complete eradication of old buildings. Rather, a harmonious blend of old and new can be achieved, where older structures coexist with modern ones, creating a rich tapestry of history and innovation.

In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the proposition that old buildings should be destroyed and replaced with modern structures. Their preservation is essential to maintain a connection to our cultural heritage, retain a unique sense of place, and promote sustainable urban environments. Embracing the past alongside progress can lead to the creation of vibrant and diverse communities for future generations to enjoy.",Some people think old buildings should be destroyed and replaced with modern buildings.

"In recent years, the conservation and protection of wild animals have become increasingly significant topics of discussion. It is crucial for humans to recognize the importance of safeguarding these creatures and take necessary measures to ensure their survival. This essay delves into the reasons why protecting wild animals is crucial, the threats they face, and the potential solutions.

Firstly, wild animals play a vital role in maintaining ecological balance. Various species contribute to the delicate balance of their respective ecosystems by regulating populations of other organisms and preserving biodiversity. For instance, predatory animals help regulate the population of herbivores, thereby preventing overgrazing and the consequent degradation of vegetation.

Furthermore, wildlife tourism has emerged as a significant source of income for many countries. Protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife reserves, attract millions of tourists annually. These visitors contribute to local economies by spending on accommodation, transportation, and various tourist services. Therefore, protecting wild animals not only helps maintain ecological equilibrium but also bolsters economic growth.

However, despite their undeniable importance, wild animals face numerous threats that compromise their survival. Habitat loss due to deforestation, urbanization, and industrialization is one of the most significant challenges. Human activities encroach upon natural habitats, leaving animals with limited spaces to forage, breed, and roam freely. Additionally, wildlife trafficking and hunting for commercial purposes pose a severe threat to many endangered species.

To address these challenges, several steps can be taken. First, governments should implement stricter regulations and penalties against wildlife trafficking. By increasing law enforcement efforts and imposing harsher punishments, the immoral practices of capturing and trading wild animals can be curtailed. Second, conservation organizations should work in collaboration with governments to establish and maintain protected areas that provide safe habitats for endangered species. These areas should also be equipped with proper monitoring systems, preventing unauthorized activities and ensuring the well-being of the animals.

Furthermore, raising public awareness regarding the importance of protecting wild animals is vital. Education campaigns and programs at schools, universities, and public forums can play a pivotal role in informing the public about the consequences of wildlife exploitation. This awareness can lead to improved attitudes and responsible behavior towards wild animals and their habitats.

In conclusion, the protection of wild animals is of utmost importance for the maintenance of ecological balance and the welfare of our planet. The threats faced by these creatures necessitate immediate action. Governments, conservation organizations, and the public must work collaboratively to implement stricter laws, establish protected areas, and raise awareness to ensure the preservation and safeguarding of wild animals for generations to come.",Protect wild animals,7.0,429.0,25.0,17.16,32.0,9.0,6.72,257.0,0.324009324009324,0.1724941724941724,0.1351981351981352,0.0046620046620046,0.0186480186480186,13.0,0.049618320610687,5.84,0.5051334702258727,421.0,157.3271557987443,2.0,-0.0867978278799451,157.24035797086435,13.5,17.0,18.33,4.684586878314412,0.161,0.084,0.755,56.0,0.0,0.3449691991786447,0,0,1,1.0
"Recently, a great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation. Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation, while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution. In my opinion, I strongly agree that alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced. In this essay, several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages.

Firstly, an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution. Since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air, the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants. Therefore, it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles.

Secondly, an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion. Once we get into the traffic jam, it forces us to waste our time for a while. What is worse, traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result, it leads to an increase of traffic accidents. Thus, the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented.

In order to solve these problems, alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively. With regard to the former, alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal. For example, rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries. This system is that at the corner of each district, the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee. Since bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses, it is a better form to protect environment than automobile. As for the latter point, the introduction of international laws can be also effective. For instance, there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only. Thus, these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution.

In summary, even though some people claim the convenience of automobile, I would state that alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion.",Alternative forms of transport to alleviate traffic congestion,5.0,388.0,20.0,19.4,38.0,12.0,9.65,199.0,0.306701030927835,0.1288659793814432,0.0979381443298969,0.0309278350515463,0.0231958762886597,11.0,0.0564102564102564,5.4,0.4441860465116279,380.0,150.25468225026307,3.0,-0.333770951143027,149.92091129912004,12.0,13.9,13.69,4.182405323743424,0.1,0.066,0.834,49.0,3.0,0.4488372093023255,10,5,2,0.0
"Gun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society, which is strictly controlled in most countries. However, gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others. Therefore, this is still a controversial topic around the world. From my point of view, it is sensible to enforce the gun control.

The first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns. The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns. For example, we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting. So the fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates.

Secondly, most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people. Eventually, guns will create a violent society if the trend continues. Take an example, in American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting. What is worse, some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger.

Thirdly, the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide. In the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent. Unfortunately, there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over.

In conclusion, considering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates, I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence.",Gun control,5.0,280.0,16.0,17.5,38.0,10.0,8.9375,178.0,0.2964285714285714,0.1214285714285714,0.0821428571428571,0.025,0.0321428571428571,9.0,0.0652173913043478,5.188,0.5329153605015674,276.0,108.48430959776162,0.0,0.0,108.48430959776162,8.9,11.1,10.84,4.028762966672268,0.053,0.282,0.664,32.0,3.0,0.4482758620689655,0,0,1,0.0
"The increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past. It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly. I will analyze these areas in the essay.

Firstly, the major source of energy today is water. Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source. To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short. Thus, during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India. If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity. Therefore, it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources.

Secondly, the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming. For example, the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming. In the same way, the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution.

To conclude, it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy. This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming. Further, government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy",Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy,4.0,256.0,15.0,17.066666666666666,24.0,8.0,9.0,138.0,0.26171875,0.1328125,0.1484375,0.0234375,0.03515625,8.0,0.065040650406504,5.667,0.4802867383512544,254.0,107.81212806337489,0.0,0.0,107.81212806337489,11.1,11.5,11.83,3.702328925563663,0.173,0.026,0.801,28.0,1.0,0.4838709677419355,2,1,2,0.0
"Technology, in the past two hundred years, has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society, such as telecommunications, manufacturing and buildings, etc. Certainly, technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives. However, today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor. Personally, I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons.

In the first instance, the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products. About ten years ago, mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country, only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one. Today, mobile phones become a common one of household items, which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies. Thus, most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements, especially the poor people.

Secondly, technical developments improve productivity, which help people to escape from daily chores, and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life. With the development of Internet, we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day. In the past time, we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us. Nowadays, we can talk with our friends online, no matter where we are and how far between us. In addition, the Internet gives everyone access to the same information, this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals.

Undoubtedly, everything has two sides and technology is not an exception. To some extent, the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology, because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products, and these products can help them to earn more in return.

Nevertheless, I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology, and technology is not the root cause of the gap.

In conclusion, the good technology bringing to us is undeniable. Under proper use of technology, the human being can be benefit a lot and perpetually from the advancement of it.",technology that widen the gap between rich and poor?,6.0,380.0,18.0,21.11111111111111,38.0,10.0,11.22222222222222,223.0,0.2578947368421053,0.1052631578947368,0.1105263157894736,0.05,0.0131578947368421,8.0,0.0446927374301676,5.778,0.4860465116279069,375.0,160.34295451329498,0.0,0.0,160.34295451329498,11.5,12.8,11.08,4.393480479758787,0.198,0.038,0.764,47.0,3.0,0.4697674418604651,0,0,1,0.0
"For most folks on Earth, the need to gather in one place, and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation. This trend is so deeply engraved in people's mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned, even when some participants are facing grievous social problems. It is agreed that large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes, and help them being proud of their nation. This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace, and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols.

Firstly, during times of war, people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event. For example, when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War, its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers. This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back, sooner or later, to a relative peaceful normality. Thus, world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace.

Secondly, these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country. For instance, when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa, its citizens filled up the stadiums, cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field. South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night. This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team. As a result, it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events.

In conclusion, after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries, it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society, but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness. This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future.",Sporting events easing international tensions,4.0,372.0,15.0,24.8,42.0,14.0,11.8,227.0,0.2446236559139785,0.1317204301075268,0.1129032258064516,0.021505376344086,0.0161290322580645,10.0,0.0510204081632653,5.867,0.5441176470588235,363.0,146.91848805036133,4.0,-0.4452559620070673,146.47323208835425,11.8,15.9,13.18,4.533942464095222,0.16,0.053,0.786,55.0,7.0,0.4338235294117647,0,0,1,0.0
"Despite the development of modern society, the health care and education still remain the basic rights of citizens. And a much debated issue these days is whether or not the government should be responsible for citizens' health care and education.

Some people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens. This is because citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment, which should be enabled by the government, the leader of the society. If citizens had no access to health care and education, their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk. As a result, such people might fail to get cured in time, thus influencing their working efficiency, which would destabilize the production of the industry. Also, without sufficient guidance of teachers, these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes, posing a threat to other citizens' security. Therefore, the government should be accountable for citizens' health care and education to keep society safe and stable.

On the other hand, some people oppose the argument, saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society, since a great number of people, in fact, have had the capacity to pay for the both privately. Instead, the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members' wellbeing, such as soaring crime rate, AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure, which are requiring financial resources from the government to address.

Personally, I think the government should fund the deprived for their health care and education, who are the group in real need for the authority's help. At the same time, citizens available for the both should encourage the government to allocate money to more urgent areas.

"Never in history was advertising industry so developed as in modern society and it has led to some adverse sentiments in public because some deliver exaggerated and fake information. Hence whether we should ban all the advertisements or not has aroused much controversy of the public. My view is that while some of them are disturbing, we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring.

First, it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring. In fact, they are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture, good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor.

Besides, it is obvious that publicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies. In a larger sense, it could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country. A recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign, the sales revenue would increase by 40%, which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic.

That is not to say, however, that advertisements have no downsides. Of course, the advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information, creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies. Yet, its merits still outweigh these downsides.

Taken all together, advertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth. We can not deny all of them.

"Currently, a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries. However, some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems. From my perspective, I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation.

Admittedly, some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection, thus ruining the local environments. As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources, advanced technologies and experience, they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards. Besides, people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems. As a result, unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen, which can put a strain on the natural resources. In this view, the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting.

However, I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment. With people raising their awareness of the green economy, the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients, which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favourable impression on customers today, triggering sales. For example, electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years.

Furthermore, taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies. If a firm is environmentally conscious, it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment, which can boost productivity. Therefore, it may spur its economic development. On the other hand, without the requirement of environmental preservation, the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs, being a hurdle to the economic develpment.

Therefore, I would conclude that thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously. On the other hand, I suppose the developed countries should support the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources, technologies and experience so that the environmental problems can be effectively alleviated in these areas.",economic development vs environment,5.0,341.0,17.0,20.058823529411764,36.0,7.0,9.529411764705882,201.0,0.2609970674486803,0.1700879765395894,0.1407624633431085,0.0205278592375366,0.0498533724340175,6.0,0.0331491712707182,4.824,0.5,338.0,136.10529196394288,0.0,0.0,136.10529196394288,13.5,16.3,16.13,4.399432483068324,0.16,0.053,0.787,38.0,1.0,0.421875,0,0,1,0.0
"The introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication. With this situation, some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language. I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means.

First of all, it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging, which answers to the question of their great popularity. Before email and mobile phone, human beings communicated by meeting directly, sending letters or later, calling from home phones. Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness, difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information. However, email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above. People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want. Especially, thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging (SMS), it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information, even to many people at the same time. They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways.

The popularity of email and text messaging, as a result, leads to the losing of written language's position. People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities. The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form. Even in some cases, people compose a message with only emoticons (the expressions by face created by service providers), which means there is no room for writing or typing texts. Moreover, it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying, writing assignments. If that tendency continues at a rapid pace, written language may face up to a real problem about its stand.

In conclusion, we cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity.

"The modern times have witnessed profound changes in most aspects of life, including the revolution of feminism. Women have been opened up to more chances than ever. This, contrary to some ideas, is a positive progress in human society from my point of view.

To start with, the fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society. Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children. Women nowadays are much more active, they may be successful businessmen, they join the political world, they become scientists and so on. This is to say, the ""weaker"" gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men, not to mention they even perform better in some fields.

In the second place, the revolution in females' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well. The financial burden of families, for instance, has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money. What is more, women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers lie healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration.

Admittedly, such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate or, under many circumstances, women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives. Also, children might enjoy less care from parents as they arre both busy with theit work. Yet everything has it upside and downside, women should find the best way to overcome such challenges.

"The internet has been more and more popular for recent years, providing people with a huge source of information. As a result of this, print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers. Some people, however, still believe that they can exist for long time; others disagree, arguing that newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence. Personally, I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons.

First of all, to obtain information, using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers. Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper, nowadays, they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, everywhere and at anytime. As can be seen, these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world, making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages. Hence, the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information.

Another point is that, from the economic aspect, buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one. It is clear to recognize that the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries. The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same, even usually less information than those he can have with the internet? The answer, perhaps, is that hardly would rational people do so. For this reason, the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply, possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time.

Last, but not least, when taking environment into consideration, people must conceive that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down. This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today. At this point, newspapers' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive.

In conclusion, it might be unpleasant for some advocating newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media. However, this, if occurring, should be seen as a result of the ever- increasing innovations in media technology and in our modern life as a whole.",Will newspapers become a thing of the past?,5.0,403.0,18.0,22.38888888888889,39.0,11.0,12.666666666666666,243.0,0.2406947890818858,0.1464019851116625,0.0967741935483871,0.0173697270471464,0.0272952853598014,10.0,0.0568181818181818,6.556,0.5143487858719646,397.0,176.58437540021976,0.0,0.0,176.58437540021976,12.0,13.2,11.15,4.515500850615564,0.055,0.047,0.898,47.0,3.0,0.5033112582781457,0,0,1,0.0
"Why shouldn't schools do locker checks? Why do many students oppose locker checks? Random locker checks are not done to torment and/or invade the privacy of the students, but for many other important reasons which include school security. These checks are required because malicious students bring drugs and weapons to school and store them in the lockers. Random locker checks should be made obligatory and done frequently to assure the wellbeing of the students.

In the first place, locker checks help increase the safety in schools. Safety is a problem in every environment and especially school. Drugs, alcohol, and firearms in lockers make a harmless place like school quite dangerous. School was known to be a secure environment for children where they could learn and have a have a fun time with friends. In the past 10 years that has all changed. The number of school shootings has increased significantly. Last year on April 16th the most deadly school shooting in U.S. history occurred. In this brutal massacre at Virginia Tech, 32 students were murdered and several more were wounded. To combat this growing epidemic, schools carry out repeated locker checks.

In the second place, locker checks keep students healthy. Locker checks help students stay both physically and mentally healthy because it discourages students from bringing fire arms and especially drugs. As everyone knows, drugs induce immense physical damage and when it is overdosed drugs can lead to death. As a result, drugs completely destroy a student's life. To prevent problems like this locker checks are required. Without the use of drugs, school security will increase dramatically. If the school is safe, students will no be frightened or strained.

Lastly, more students will comply with the school policies because there are frequent locker checks and other students are getting caught and punished for it. The students who are yet to be caught will learn from the mistakes of other students and will stop. To increase the effect of locker checks, they should be done with security guards and dogs. Security guards at school increase security and security dogs help find drugs with their noses. School is a place to learn, not a place to bring malicious substances, electronics and etc. So, only learning material should be brought to school. With the continued discouraging of bringing drugs and weapons, a completely secure school will become an accomplishable goal.

Locker checks should be made mandatory and done frequently because they assure security in schools, makes students healthy, and will make students obey school policies in the future. Students should appreciate locker checks and other measures taken by the school to protect the school and the students. Privacy is a small price to pay for security against drugs and weapons.

"Studies are an essential part of life.Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies, while in some countries, it is considered as waste of time. However, a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school.

In most education systems, a child studies continously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age. A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change. A continous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot, to follow instructions. Personally, a break will give students some time to refresh their systems, by travelling or following their hobbies. Importantly, when students start their university studies after a break, they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge.

Nevertheless, during high school, many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in. Working or travelling for some time, after high school, can help them to find their field of interest. It will also help them to learn professional setup by working. Financially,students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job. Some students even utilise this time for preparation of their desired university course.

However, there are also disadvantages. A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental. When students work during these breaks, the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia. For instance, my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted. When he started his university studies, he failed miserably. Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time. But , the break should be an optional thing. It varies from individual to individual, how they utilise that period. A break gives students more benefits than harms.

Importantly, the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them. Thus, a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies. Countries, like India, where such a break is considered a blot, should understand that young minds are delicate and they face a cut-throat competition. One year break can help young people to prepare for the challenges of life.",is a break good or bad after high school for students,5.0,396.0,25.0,15.84,33.0,5.0,7.88,208.0,0.2929292929292929,0.1616161616161616,0.0833333333333333,0.0429292929292929,0.0328282828282828,10.0,0.0497512437810945,4.5,0.4394618834080717,392.0,159.13977577732967,1.0,-0.0205580009992681,159.11921777633043,8.0,9.8,10.49,3.923470714105,0.109,0.047,0.843,53.0,10.0,0.4417040358744394,2,1,2,0.0
"The legalization of marijuana would help get the economy going again. Despite great efforts by the federal government against marijuana, it has become a large part of the national economy. Imagine if we were to legalize and tax it, the government would make tons of profit and we could start paying off this $16trillion national debt. Not to mention it would create tons of jobs and people in prison for marijuana crimes would be released. In a country with only 5% of the earth's population, the United States holds 25% of the world's prisoners (""Marijuana Prison Statistics""). A significant amount of those criminals are in there for drug related crimes.

The war on drugs is a complete failure. It's done nothing but waste tax payer dollars, fill prisons with non violent criminals, and create a black market. The main reason cannabis remains illegal is because lobbyists are making tons of money off of prohibition. For example, Pharmaceutical companies lobby against cannabis because at a lower price, there are so many drugs (painkillers, sleep medication) it could replace. Another group that benefits greatly from prohibition are the drug cartels. Legalize marijuana and you cut a huge percent of their profits, army strength, and political power. Otherwise they're going to do whatever they can to save the marijuana black market.

You could argue that marijuana is physically unhealthy for you and that's why it's illegal. But then you'd have to explain why alcohol and tobacco are legal because those substances are way more harmful than cannabis. 79,000 people a year die from alcohol poisoning, while zero people have died from overdosing on pot People think that prohibition has kept marijuana out of children's hands. They think legalizing this drug would expose more children and teens to it. It's a whole lot easier for kids to obtain marijuana as opposed to alcohol or tobacco. A drug dealer doesn't check for ID like a cashier would. Teens are susceptible to harsher drugs after trying marijuana because they are introduced to these hardcore drugs in the same underground market where they got the marijuana, not because it's a gateway drug. Another thing that is often said is that marijuana is addictive and can be abused, thus making it mentally unhealthy. This is an unfair statement, anything has the potential to be abused, even something as simple as food.

You never hear about the positive effects marijuana can have on society. Many musicians admit that cannabis helps them get creative with their music and opens their minds to new ideas and concepts. Many cancer patients have used medical marijuana as a way of dealing with nausea after treatment or stimulating their appetite. The point is people have benefited from marijuana whether it was for medical or recreational purposes. Cannabis is classified as a schedule one drug, this suggests that it is as dangerous and addictive as heroin, meth, and even more dangerous than cocaine.

"Innovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life; however, some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government. It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create.

One of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society; however, I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work. It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning. If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value; if the art reflects the reality, then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth? Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth? In a word, the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified.

Let's then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals. It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc. I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents; however, in the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide - these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art.

By way of conclusion, I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work; on the contrary, they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas - this world needs them to make itself colourful.",Creative Artists,4.0,359.0,11.0,32.63636363636363,65.0,13.0,18.818181818181817,209.0,0.2311977715877437,0.1559888579387186,0.0696378830083565,0.0557103064066852,0.0278551532033426,9.0,0.0580645161290322,7.273,0.5215189873417722,351.0,147.2499853963434,7.0,-0.52518861534427,146.72479678099916,14.8,18.3,11.67,4.413069877175876,0.136,0.096,0.768,46.0,5.0,0.5240506329113924,0,0,1,0.0
"With the development of globalization, English became the dominated language in national trade, conference and many important events. This phenomenon has aroused a heated discussion in public.

Some people claim that the prevalent of English brings a great number of benefits for people. First of all, it promotes the communication and interaction between different countries more conveniently and clearly. In the ancient time, the different languages and geography set barriers for people to exchange their goods and ideas. Fortunately, the innovation of plane and train solved the geographical barriers. If we can popularize the use of English, the language hinder will disappear as well. In addition, English is a beautiful language, which is more systematical and extensive than many other languages. Learning English can foster people's sentiment and nourish their literature and art.

However, the opponents believe that the dominated status of English has destroyed culture diversity and many less-used languages become extinct. Even English is a sophisticated language; it does not express every detail of life especially in Asia countries, which have totally different linguistic system. It is undeniable that language contains many aspects of people's daily life, which is influenced by culture, environment as well as religious. Obviously, these languages have special significance for people who belong to them and using English to replace them is crudity.

"The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate with proponenets maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy while opponents argue that atomic technology is uncontrollable and very dangerous to handle. As far as my opinion is concerned , I find myself aligned with opponenets of the usages of nuclear power. I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages.

First and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons. Last centuary has witnesed the horrors of such weapons. If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for millitary usage.

Another reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity. For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area. This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are unevitable.

Last but not least, while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power. Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanat solution of it. This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazordous material.

To sum it up, from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that nuclear power may apear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the adavantages. Thus i suggest that use of nuclear technology should be discouraged even for civil purposes.",The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy,5.0,294.0,14.0,21.0,37.0,9.0,10.785714285714286,184.0,0.238095238095238,0.1122448979591836,0.1394557823129251,0.0442176870748299,0.0136054421768707,8.0,0.056338028169014,6.071,0.5870967741935483,270.0,105.28637477354644,7.0,-0.828211723422542,104.45816305012389,11.4,12.4,11.14,4.347988423142524,0.077,0.138,0.786,28.0,16.0,0.4870967741935484,0,0,1,0.0
"Presently, it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school. Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject. Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children. While, others claim that studying only one subject is more effective. Before rendering my own opinion, I will explore sides of this topic.

The benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized. In the first place, with some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future. Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate. In students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes. However, still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done. Besides, most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs.

Those who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness. This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects. However, the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected. Most importantly, under such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study. Moreover, the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study.

It is undeniable that concentrating on one subject can reduce students' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents, while its shortfalls are so vital to students' future. Therefore, I do support the view of learning all school subjects.",should teenagers learn all school subjects/focus on one subject,4.0,308.0,18.0,17.11111111111111,28.0,10.0,8.88888888888889,192.0,0.2694805194805195,0.1590909090909091,0.1103896103896103,0.0292207792207792,0.0259740259740259,9.0,0.0596026490066225,5.111,0.5360230547550432,307.0,122.5993156090948,0.0,0.0,122.5993156090948,10.0,12.9,13.4,4.19302558779985,0.133,0.072,0.794,48.0,0.0,0.4610951008645533,0,0,1,0.0
"Today, the rate of unemployment is on the rise and is seriously being debated by many. Some opine that the best method to minimize this problem is by providing the unemployed with hand phones that have access to the Internet. They also believe that this solution is the most appropriate way to utilize the public money. Nevertheless, I agree to this solution only to a certain degree because I feel that giving those with no work a mobile phone each is a total waste of money.

In a positive point of view, when people without jobs have hand phones that have access to the Internet, they will be able to browse the net for more job opportunities. For example, they can surf the The Star Onlines' work section to find a job that is suitable for them. With the help of the net, they can also do more research on the work that they have found apart from looking up on how they can prepare themselves for the job. Not only that, the mobile phones can also be used to make calls with the companies in which they would like to work with. In short, if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone, they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive.

Nonetheless, looking from another perspective, supplying hand phones to the unemployed is a waste of the taxpayers' money. This is because the money instead of being used to supply the electronic gadget can be used for other useful purposes for the country. To illustrate this further, the money can be used to build more amenities for the public or given to the poor so that they can use it to help them earn a living. To conclude, the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed.

Furthermore, when hand phones are provided for free, many would want to take advantage of this opportunity. It will not be surprising that in order to obtain a mobile phone, they make themselves jobless. Some might even go to the extent of lying that they are on unemployment to make them eligible to get the phones. In this context, the public's money is spent worthlessly. On top of that, till now, there are no surveys or evidences that prove this method in effective in reducing the rate of unemployment.

To put it in a nutshell, the suggestion of providing those who are jobless with mobile phones that are accessible to internet is not a proper and the best way to trim down the rate of unemployment. I suggest the government look into the background of the people in depth before giving out hand phones to them.

"Personally, I believe that married women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly. Working outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household. I will mention some basic reasons as following.

Firstly, extra income that women earn will contribute to their family's expenses. By taking up a job, a wife can earn more money to support her family life. This is really necessary in cases of her husband's low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present. So, it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money.

Secondly, working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world, strengthen their character and show their capacity. These things in turn will make them more confident, independent. These women will set a good example for their children. Therefore, it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better.

Last but not least, nowadays, there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work. Besides the gorvernment's policies on limited families and their husbands' sharing in the housework, many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women.

It can be seen that some developed countries and organization are proving financial assistance to the impoverished countries. However, it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries. This will be proven by analyzing the necessity of developing their education and the real objective of supporters.

Firstly, education is an essential part in development. For instance, most developing countries are lack of educational resources, such as experienced teachers, evaluation systems and teaching facilities, which is usually neglected by local authorities. From this example, it is obvious that if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education, the developing countries will remain undeveloped, even though they gain a great deal of economic support. Thus, the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid.

In addition, it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world. This means some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market. Indeed, they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas. Therefore, developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries.

In conclusion, financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries. And it has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation.",Financial Aid To Developing Countries,4.0,277.0,14.0,19.785714285714285,36.0,8.0,9.642857142857142,160.0,0.2346570397111913,0.1552346570397112,0.1299638989169675,0.0433212996389891,0.0180505415162454,13.0,0.0915492957746478,5.857,0.5130718954248366,273.0,120.54644969163982,0.0,0.0,120.54644969163982,13.4,14.5,14.1,4.11114865393165,0.155,0.063,0.782,35.0,1.0,0.4411764705882353,0,0,1,0.0
"In the recent years, we have to face up to a serious problem: air pollution, which is predicted out of control in the future. It directly affects our lives. Air pollution occurs when the atmosphere contains gases, dust or fumes in harmful amount.

The pollution isn't natural, how it appeared? There are some causes. First, factories dump untreated heat, smog and sewage, waste into environment. Second, vehicles make exhaust and dust. Third, consumer and commercial products make landfills from its waste. Fourth, people burn trash and fossil fuel, it produces carbon dioxide. Finally, in agriculture, chemical substances (pesticide and herbicide), fire smoke and pollen can also be pollutants.

We are living in a big air tank. If the air is polluted, of course people are affected. Air pollution harm our respiratory systems, it leads to pneumonia, bronchitis, lung cancer or even the death. It changes the ecosystem, kills animals and botanical species. Air pollution contaminates water and soil, cause global warming and natural disaster.

We call for some solutions. Factories and transport must have exhaust treatment system. If people use electric public transport, cycle or walk, there'll be less poisonous fume. We ought to use environmentally-friendly products and renewable fuel, follow the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle) and put out all the fire. We shouldn't use fireplace or wood stove for heating and cooking. And the most important action is plant more trees - our nature lungs.

Protect the environment is our crucial responsibility. It needs our hands.

"As people have raised their democratic awareness in recent years, they are caring more about how the tax expenditure is distributed by the government. As a result, some people suggest that the tax money should be allocated to publically beneficial services instead of arts. However, from my perspective, I think arts are supposed to be included in the government's investment as well.

Admittedly, the government should give priority to public services and facilities. This is because the government plays the role of a leader among citizens, which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable. Simultaneously, public services such as education system or medical care can meet people's basic demand of survival, security and knowledge, thus making them feel comfortable, which can lower the crime rate. Therefore, public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability.

On the other hand, I believe arts should by no means been disregarded by the government. Individually, arts can enrich people's cultural lives. Currently, people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition. Consequently, they require various entertainment such as music, movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure. Without arts, people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems.

From the point of the local community, funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development. Cultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts. This means preserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage, which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry. In this view, arts serve cultural and economic purposes .

With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that public services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure. At the same time, the authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous.",Government should spend money on ARTs,5.0,332.0,18.0,18.444444444444443,35.0,7.0,8.944444444444445,197.0,0.286144578313253,0.1475903614457831,0.1234939759036144,0.0210843373493975,0.036144578313253,10.0,0.0578034682080924,5.111,0.5106951871657754,329.0,136.10380700673758,0.0,0.0,136.10380700673758,11.6,13.5,13.69,4.2818593640995335,0.112,0.058,0.83,43.0,2.0,0.4304812834224599,0,0,1,0.0
"As we read newspapers or watch TV, we have always been attracted by environmental problems such as traffic issues, air and water pollution questions. Initiatives should be taken to address the specific problems. As the impacts for those pollution and traffic issues are extremely far-reaching, it is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems, though it is a promising method discussed in the contemporary society.

Specifically, price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas, for example, in the farming products and in the real estate area; however, whether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated. On one hand, governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands. Consequently, it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly. On the other hand, pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil, chemical pollutants, extra lights, also constitute considerable amount of pollution. In addition, the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace, resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours.

As illustrated before, several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems. Primarily, authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities, such as constructing more bus lines, in order to reducing the usage of private cars. Furthermore, temporarily targets should be set, with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time, for example, a season. Plus with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems. Meanwhile, cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out, though it might not be into effect immediately, but in the long run, it would be a wise choice.

In conclusion, addressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price Is not adequate, while improving transportation facilities and building supervisory institution would be preferable, plus with the awareness of environmental protection being raised.",Growing traffic & pollution can be controlled by increasing petrol prices,4.0,322.0,14.0,23.0,40.0,9.0,10.928571428571429,192.0,0.3074534161490683,0.1614906832298136,0.0962732919254658,0.0248447204968944,0.031055900621118,6.0,0.0346820809248554,6.357,0.5054347826086957,321.0,129.7785274145746,1.0,-0.0381630717686207,129.74036434280598,14.6,16.6,14.74,4.387886736078267,0.085,0.048,0.867,57.0,2.0,0.4157608695652174,0,0,1,0.0
"Children tend to visit zoos where various kinds of wild creatures could be seen. When it comes to whether zoos should exist on contemporary society, animal-right activists strongly recommended that wildlife belong to natural environment and zoos should be banned. I would not go along with their viewpoint as zoos have irreplaceable benefits in terms of animal preservation and children education.

There is no denying that our environment is damaged day by day due to the fact that excessive pursuit of economic development at expense of eco-system, which pose a great threat to the survival of wild animals. In contrast, zoo is a good alternative choice for protecting animals as various animals could be better protected by specialized staff. Once the animal got sick, professional vet will help them promptly. Thanks to the considerate care, the diversity of wild animal could be guaranteed.

Additionally, zoos afford a platform to education teenagers, helping to establish eco-friendly behavior towards animals. In the zoos, even though wild animals are caged, they have capability to walk in a limited area. When children pay a visit to the zoos, they still could observe the eating behavior or leisure activities among animals, which would definitely enrich their knowledge associated with different animals. Further, children could acquire the information regarding how to protect wild animals according to guided tour or volunteers.

On the other hand, complained about the drawbacks of zoos are often heard. It is true that some zoos are lack of systematic management which attributes to numerous wild animals die because of food shortage. Also, being caged in the zoos for long render wildlife lost the ability to survive in nature where is full of cruel competition among various animals.

In order to protect animals, from my perspective, zoos offer a good man-made environment which could prolong the life span of wild animals and cultivate the notion of protecting animals. What the zoos should do is improvement of the management system and use the income wisely in preserving wild animals better.",zoos should be banned,5.0,336.0,16.0,21.0,37.0,11.0,9.875,200.0,0.3005952380952381,0.175595238095238,0.1071428571428571,0.0238095238095238,0.0357142857142857,14.0,0.0769230769230769,6.875,0.532608695652174,335.0,126.86734110866476,0.0,0.0,126.86734110866476,12.7,13.9,12.76,4.13098397266146,0.162,0.095,0.743,37.0,1.0,0.4293478260869565,0,0,1,0.0
"The purpose of this essay is to discuss whether or not the only way to motivate employees to be more hard-working and productive is by raising their salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the factors for higher yields and finish by stating my position on this.

A raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places. Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile. For instance, junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work due to the fact that it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want. If the teachers receive higher salaries, they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth, as this is what is happening in Taiwan.

Nevertheless, I believe that creating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances. Take Google for example, the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce. By doing this, the employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured.

To sum up, I believe that a higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees. Alternatively, providing a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity since they will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses.",Paying more money is the only motivation to make employees work harder,4.0,295.0,11.0,26.818181818181817,49.0,15.0,14.727272727272728,180.0,0.2,0.1661016949152542,0.1016949152542373,0.047457627118644,0.0271186440677966,4.0,0.0296296296296296,6.455,0.5615141955835962,293.0,124.23304662603582,0.0,0.0,124.23304662603582,12.6,15.8,11.84,4.464910833144218,0.219,0.026,0.755,52.0,0.0,0.5110410094637224,0,0,1,0.0
"Unemployment is clearly a global problem, be it in developed countries or developing ones. However, I tend to believe it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens, rather than the government, to help them out.

Government money should be spent on publicly benefitial programs only. Tax revenue is collected from those who works. Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers. Besides, there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure, such as health care service and education, so addressing unemployment should have low priority.

Also, it is obvious that, to survive in this competitive world, one has to work hard and equip themselves well. If they could get free financial help from the government, they might end up with out any motivation to work at all.

Of course, this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance. They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support. In this case, the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them, so that they can have the chance to get back to work. After all, it is benefitial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again.

In conclusion, my point of view is that, although the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people, direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity.",Should governments be responsible to help the unemployed and homeless,5.0,261.0,13.0,20.07692307692308,39.0,8.0,12.076923076923077,165.0,0.2068965517241379,0.1570881226053639,0.0881226053639846,0.0804597701149425,0.0498084291187739,5.0,0.0476190476190476,5.692,0.5445205479452054,254.0,120.28633156247996,3.0,-0.1918836142436681,120.0944479482363,9.9,12.1,10.97,4.185652197278584,0.105,0.126,0.77,36.0,5.0,0.5376712328767124,0,0,1,0.0
"For many centuries, outer space has been one of the most favourable realms of study. Space expeditions have been launched and many have been successful. However, a lot of people still consider space exploration as an act of wasting money, to illustrate, astronauts only brought useless rocks back to planet earth despite the large sum of money spent on their equipment. On the other hand, there are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space.

Firstly, many facts about solar system can be discovered. For instance, a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round, not flat. Another example is that it is the earth which goes around the sun, not vice versa. If it was not for the space exploration, we would never know these facts.

Secondly, people can know more about the planet earth itself. By observing planet earth from outer space, people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth. With this knowledge, people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming.

Finally, a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented. As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in, scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks. Oxygen tanks, for instance, are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater. Moreover, spaceships, communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society.

An international sporting event is normal held in a country with huge interest from fans all over the world. For the time of occasions, people regardless of nationality, origin and religion will live together. People can understand more about a country, it is useful to ease tensions between nations.

"Primary and secondary education provide a basic knowledge and skills to the people in this world. I completely agree that government should provide those education to their people; however, for the more higher education like university, the students or their parents should pay for the fees.

Some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children university fees. In the other hand, I don't think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students' primary and secondary education. It is better for them to use the money to pay for the other students' education so that all people in their country could receive the same education.

Moreover, students that already have a basic knowledge and education can get a part-time job and they can pay for their own studies when their parent could not afford to pay it. They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves. In addition to that, the students will become more independent and it will build their characters in the marketplace as well.

Furthermore, this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives as they need to make some contribution too for their children future.

"Everyday, companies offer a huge number of different products to consumers. The most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product is through advertising. However, it is not sufficient in itself. The product also should satisfy the needs of the consumers. In my opinion, advertising is the major reason for high sales of a product for several reasons.

We are mainly introduced to products through advertisements. Therefore, advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product. When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised, they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases. Recently, there is a very creative advirtesement of a soft drink product on TV. The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot. As a result of this, the number of that product being sold will increases.

Also, the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media, the more popular the product becomes. Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product. Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product. When a product is commonly used, it becomes trustworthy for the society, no matter what quality it is.. However it also has to be affordable for the consumer. Considering this fact, advertisements have undeniable affects on the society about the product being advertised. They make the product preferable.

In conclusion, as I believe that consumers should consider major needs when they purchase goods, high sales are obviously a reflection of the powerful advertisements.

"Nowadays, more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals, since it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society. However it is obvious that cooked food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients, ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people's eating habits. In this essay, I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above.

First of all, to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people. Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences. For instance, there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases. Thus, easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health.

Not cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition. It is truth that cooking prepared foods needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food., whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared foods are unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up .

In addition, cooking is one of arts humans create. The more cooked food we chosen, the more cooking skills we lose. At the increasing living pace, the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes. But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits, which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking.

In conclusion, although the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work, it is not a good thing. Cooking is not a waste of time, contrarily, it is crucial for our health and culture.",Prepared Food,5.0,327.0,15.0,21.8,42.0,8.0,11.4,203.0,0.2568807339449541,0.1437308868501529,0.1039755351681957,0.0397553516819571,0.018348623853211,9.0,0.0566037735849056,6.2,0.5401662049861495,324.0,138.47507141514797,1.0,-0.0735715313593869,138.40149988378857,10.1,12.3,10.97,4.325307527658716,0.105,0.069,0.826,38.0,4.0,0.4736842105263157,2,1,2,0.0
"It is quite common that more and more people can watch exhibitions through television or internet at home due to modern technology; therefore, some people think museums and art galleries will disappear soon. Although modern technology make it possible, I still believe some museums and art galleries will not disappear.

On the one hand, technology indeed simplifies people's life all the time. Obviously, people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home, save the time and money on the road, which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society. However, in accordance with recent research, experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy because they lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication.

On the other hand, the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture. First of all, authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos. It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos, so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it. Furthermore, museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages; therefore, these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture.

In conclusion, I admit that modern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions, but museums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture.",museums and art galleries will disappear soon?,4.0,240.0,10.0,24.0,37.0,12.0,12.1,143.0,0.3166666666666666,0.1166666666666666,0.0875,0.0333333333333333,0.0208333333333333,7.0,0.056910569105691,5.9,0.5055762081784386,240.0,98.19246858176196,0.0,0.0,98.19246858176196,13.8,15.7,13.29,4.027377572827508,0.091,0.04,0.869,40.0,1.0,0.449814126394052,2,1,2,0.0
"Today, close circuit television (CCTV) cameras are widely used in a variety of circumstances. They are used in schools, businesses and some other premises in order to monitor the activities taking place. It is undeniable that the use of CCTV has plenty of benefits to offer, especially in reducing crimes and protecting the employees in a premise. Nevertheless, some argue that these cameras invade their privacies due to constantly being monitored. Even so, I strongly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace.

Firstly, by having CCTV cameras at workplace, crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down. This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves, the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced. To illustrate this further, in Malaysia, policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight. Not only that, as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance, they will less likely steal from the shops. Thus, it is clear that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized.

Furthermore, at some offices, employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers. At times, face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger. Hence, the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded. In the event of an argument, the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken. In short, these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers.

Looking from another perspective, the use of CCTV cameras does cause controversy. Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras. However, one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences. Ergo, opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime.

To conclude, CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise. This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers. Admittedly, privacies are lost with the use of these cameras. Nonetheless, safety should be put first in order to be safe.",Use of CCTV cameras,5.0,436.0,23.0,18.95652173913044,34.0,10.0,10.391304347826088,243.0,0.2408256880733945,0.1766055045871559,0.0412844036697247,0.0252293577981651,0.0321100917431192,12.0,0.0603015075376884,5.522,0.4794238683127572,418.0,166.93892646090632,13.0,-0.4483571954125026,166.4905692654938,9.5,12.1,11.66,4.449085581786119,0.084,0.11,0.807,54.0,3.0,0.4917695473251028,2,1,2,0.0
"It is no secret that advertising become inseparable part of our modern life. We come across with ads almost everywhere and everyday. Some people argue that companies by advertising their goods or services spend their money for nothing. Other critics say that ads have no purpose, they only cause damages to society and all forms of advertising should be banned.

On my part I would like to solve this issue on a different way. Society does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers.

First of all, I do support the idea that advertising alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content should be prohibited. Because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children. Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis. Fortunately, some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol, cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries.

On the other hand by advertising companies, businesses, firms and individuals promote their goods and services. Thanks to ads we learn about new products, we can compare them and choose whats it the best for us.

These days, not only many businesses, but also governments have to rely on advertising. For example, tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic's economy. In order to promote the country's attractions, the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers. Only well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country.

In conclusion, I think that modern society needs advertising. Ads will keep as well informed about new products and services, but we should also bear in mind that advertising cigarettes and alcohol will definitely affect our children in negative way.",Society should ban all forms of the advertising,6.0,312.0,18.0,17.333333333333332,31.0,9.0,9.38888888888889,184.0,0.2916666666666667,0.1666666666666666,0.0641025641025641,0.0576923076923076,0.0352564102564102,11.0,0.0748299319727891,4.889,0.5043227665706052,308.0,132.117842443137,2.0,-0.0598912573691225,132.05795118576788,10.0,11.2,11.25,3.996763024557169,0.133,0.07,0.796,50.0,6.0,0.4870317002881844,0,0,1,0.0
"Man has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain. He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself. Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs, while others are concerned that animals should not be misused. This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication.

Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as, cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them. Likewise, other animals such as, horses, cattles and donkeys for farming, agriculture and as a mode of transportation. Many people keep pets like dogs and cats, trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples. They are kept for security purposes in houses.

On the other hand, many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits. For instance, cows are often injected by Oxytocin, a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation. This in turn, causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle. Furthermore, thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products. Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights. Many other practices like, equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster. And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals.

From my prospective, human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters. Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior and manipulation of them should be punished as a serious crime.",humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit?,4.0,291.0,17.0,17.11764705882353,29.0,8.0,8.941176470588236,183.0,0.3058419243986254,0.1099656357388316,0.1099656357388316,0.0274914089347079,0.0137457044673539,10.0,0.0719424460431654,5.529,0.5496894409937888,281.0,108.50855736858718,6.0,-0.3035290190428463,108.20502834954436,8.8,10.6,10.67,4.18678930888274,0.093,0.116,0.791,53.0,4.0,0.4720496894409938,0,0,1,0.0
"Nowadays, the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers, radio and television has become very prevalent, so it is thought to be a necessary part of today's society. Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this. Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.

First, it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more. Advertisements are, therefore, very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits. Also, to consumers, advertising can bring them many benefits. For example, customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans. From all of these, it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support.

However, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. Firstly, a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, this is generally known as spam, and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people. Secondly, advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results. Therefore, advertising is believed by many, a financial burden to businesses.

In conclusion, after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising, both of the views have strong support, but it is felt that more good comes from advertising than bad. Thus, the idea that advertising is a positive part of life can be more supported.",Advertising - positive or negative part of our lives,4.0,307.0,14.0,21.928571428571427,37.0,9.0,12.285714285714286,186.0,0.250814332247557,0.1368078175895765,0.1172638436482084,0.0293159609120521,0.0358306188925081,11.0,0.0808823529411764,5.429,0.521865889212828,304.0,134.43869008675986,0.0,0.0,134.43869008675986,11.8,14.2,12.42,4.135107851237242,0.149,0.048,0.803,39.0,0.0,0.5014577259475219,12,6,2,0.0
"Living in the 21st century, people are firmly convinced that technology is the main driving force behind productivity. Thus, every country has been promoting technological advances in the recent years, regardless of any potential problems it may bring about. Some people are worried modern technological technology is probably a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles. However, I believe their concern is groundless. Instead, technology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles.

In terms of time and space, technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life. In the past, only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles. This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills. However, with the access to the Internet, one of the greatest innovations in modern society, humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime, anywhere.

Additionally, technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage, making it more vivid and appealing. For example, China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo, using a variety of state-of -the-art technological methods, such as robots and LED screens. In fact, many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture.

On the other hand, some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles. They argue that people, especially youngsters, are crazier about fresh and advanced things, such as digital products, thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques. But I believe this is not the issue because people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years.

Therefore, I will conclude that technology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles. Only when traditional culture is integrated with the modern technology can it be developed in the long run.",Technology keeps traditional skills and ways of life alive or not?,5.0,336.0,17.0,19.764705882352946,31.0,7.0,9.411764705882351,200.0,0.2559523809523809,0.1279761904761904,0.1458333333333333,0.0297619047619047,0.0208333333333333,13.0,0.0730337078651685,5.706,0.5212765957446809,330.0,136.8256977397612,1.0,-0.0088057747081014,136.81689196505312,13.4,15.1,14.79,4.322076390352904,0.101,0.031,0.868,47.0,3.0,0.425531914893617,2,1,2,0.0
"Computer-a device which has given a whole new dimension to the human life. Ever since Charles Babbage (know as ""Father of computers"") invented computers, its development never had a pause. The whole world is dependent on computers, without which, the world will go back hundreds of years.

In the modern world, computers are used everywhere. Right from flying planes to sending a small document, computers are needed. They are used in space programmes , wars, hospitals, schools and so on. Computers have made human life more easy, convenient and lightning fast. For example, in earlier days , if one had to send a message to someone in other country, it used to take months. But today, it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks. Computers provide speed, increase efficiency, accuracy, precision, help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it.

Moreover, future prospects of computers are very bright. From a computer as big as a room, it has now been minimized to the size of a palm. Nanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels. Research on making computerised drone soldiers (unmanned computer controlled) is going on. There is no end to the evolution of computers.

However, everything has pros and cons. Computers have made humans over-dependent. Virus programs, privacy breach, leak of confidential documents, cyber attacks, identity theft, frauds etc. are some of its demerits, from a countless list. Computers expose children to vulgar materials. They have even invaded mental health of humans, for example , FAD (Facebook Addiction Disorder- excessive use of social networking website Facebook). Computers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives. The recent case of Wikileaks , leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful.

Nevertheless, with all the mentioned demerits, computers have provided security and sophistication too. Thus, dependence on computers is not a bad thing. However, one needs to be aware of all the pros and cons and beware of malicious things. Computer was invented for the benefit of mankind and it has fulfilled its objective.

"In our modern times, with the development of science and technology, our living standard has been improved beyond recognition. Technology, however, is not the best solution to all the world's intricate problems. Accordingly, it is believed that we need to place less emphasis on technological solutions and more on other values, such as economy, politics and education. Personally, I partly disagree with this point of view, and the reasons are given below.

To begin with, it should be borne in mind that technology plays an integral part in our lives. With the invention of computers and the Internet, we now can get easy access to all kinds of information. In addition, hi-tech devices also have a very positive impact on many aspects of our lives. They help us to work and study more efficiently, thus leading to an improvement in our abilities. Medical advances can improve our health and cure many fatal diseases. Besides, modern technology enables us to predict natural disasters much faster and more accurately, so we can reduce the number of deaths and property damage.

However, there are some serious problems springing from modern technology. First, deadly and powerful weapons can be a huge threat to the world's peace. Second, a lot of people spend too much time using hi-tech devices nowadays. They abuse them so severely that they feel they can hardly live without them. This can have a detrimental effect on their health, since they are likely to develop many dangerous diseases, including obesity, heart attack and high blood-pressure.

In conclusion, although there is no disputing the fact that technology is very crucial for our lives, in can also result in several negative drawbacks. However, I strongly believe that its advantages clearly outweigh its disadvantages, and that it can contribute greatly to the development of the world. Therefore, scientists should not place less emphasis on technological solutions, but try to pay more attention to develop new technologies instead.",Technology cannot solve all the world's problems,4.0,323.0,18.0,17.944444444444443,25.0,10.0,9.77777777777778,207.0,0.2476780185758514,0.1393188854489164,0.1145510835913312,0.0588235294117647,0.0309597523219814,5.0,0.0328947368421052,5.722,0.5405405405405406,324.0,141.509392623471,0.0,0.0,141.509392623471,10.3,12.0,11.71,4.607894021113817,0.105,0.111,0.784,49.0,0.0,0.4756756756756757,4,2,2,0.0
"Exercising is one of the most important things in life. America's number one killer is heart disease, which can easily be prevented by exercising. More that 1.6 billion people in the world are either overweight or obese and United States has the highest rate of obesity. Exercise not only reduces your risk for health problems and several diseases, but it also has an effect on overall appearance. It's proven that exercising can improve self-esteem and confidence. Excerising has numerous benefits and it can even be fun. It's important you exercise so that you can live a healthier, longer, and happier live.

The number one reason why people should exercise is because it will keep you healthy. Americans are eating enormous amounts of fast foods these days, so heart diseases are becoming more and more common. One out of every four Americans are suffering from some form of heart disease, which results in more than forty-five percent of deaths annually. The main cause of this condition is obesity. The more body fat that you have, the greater your risk for heart disease. However, this condition can easily be prevented or controlled by exercising. Exercising makes the heart muscles stronger. When your heart muscle is strong it can do the same amount of work at a lower heart rate, so the heart doesn't have to work as hard. In today's society people are less concerned with the food they and the condition that their body is in, so many serious illnesses are becoming quite common. Exercising not only helps prevent heart diseases, but it also helps prevent strokes, type 2 diabetes, and even certain types of cancer.

The second benefit to exercising is that it improves self-esteem and confidence. Most people think of exercising as only being a physical activity, but it's also a mental activity. There have been studies that show evidence that people who exercise have higher self esteem and confidence. It also showed that active people are less likely to have depression and anxiety. Exercising gives people energy, which helps people have positive outlooks on life and it helps relieves tension and stress. When you exercise you body releases endorphins, which are chemicals that create a happy feeling in brain. Plus, when you're exercising you're bringing more oxygen into you lungs and your brain appreciates the extra air. Exercising also helps improve you brain function and your memory.

In my opinion the best reason to exercise is that it's really fun! Most people think that exercising takes up a lot of time and it requires too much work. When people actually take the time to try exercising they realize it's an enjoyable experience. It doesn't matter how you exercise, as long as you are being active. Everyone enjoys different sports or activities, so it's important to figure out which is best for you. When you having fun you don't even realize that your exercising and you look forward to it everyday. Setting goals and rewards will help you stay motivated and consistent with exercising. There is no greater feeling than achieving a weight lose goal and being able to feel good about your body. It makes exercising well worth it.

In conclusion, exercising is the key to making your life healthier, longer, and happier. It is one of the most important things in life and it's one hundred percent beneficial. Many people come up with plenty of excuses to not exercise; however, if you truly want to improve your mental and physical health you will find the energy and time to exercise.

"With the current trend today of the ever-changing technology, it cannot be denied that several jobs are replaceable. On the other hand, there are still jobs which require the expertise of a human employee especially when it entails decision-making situations.

One example of a job that got replaced by the availability of technology or computer to the public is the reservation and ticketing officers of travel agencies and airlines. You can now see the availability of your intended travel dates online, make the reservation, know the price of the ticket you want to purchase and pay conveniently with your credit card and you're all done. You even have the choice of printing your own ticket or just pick it up at the airport at the day of your departure. But of course, there would still be several customers that prefer to talk with an agent in completing their purchase of a ticket. They may have several reasons to it but then maybe they are just comfortable dealing with a human being than a computer.

Jobs that the most computer can do is assist, would be that of a medical doctor. It's true that technology and computers do make their jobs easier but it cannot definitely replace them. It can have less work for them, just for instance, instead of opening up a patient to get a gallstone, they would just use an instrument that would make a point incision and guide it through inside the body to do the job for them.

With this, i still believe that technology and computers cannot eventually replace the workforce and drive employees to be jobless.

"Over the last half century the change in the life of human begings has increased beyond our wildest expectations. There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives, such as the Internet, television and cell phone. They all enrich our daily lives.Now, many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful.

Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers. They argue that teachers teach students how to write, read and calculate since they are in kindergarten.And when they are in primary school, teachers teach them more further knowledge, like writing skills and using computers.It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling. On the other hand, students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers.

Those who feel that students learn far more from other sources, such as the Internet and television, frimly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can't learn in classes. They can only input some key words and google it, and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it. In this case, stundents learn things easily. Moreover, they contend that good television programmes do teach students.For instance, Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes. Students have knowledge of others cultrues, outer space etc.

Personally, I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source. Because not only do teachers teach us knowlegde but also the skills to tell right from wrong.

"The soaring crime rate has led to the proposal that it is time for the government to take action to control the proliferation of violent scenes in media.

Obviously, violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences. This will definitely set a bad example for the immature audiences who, lacking correct parental guidance and abilities to differentiate the right from wrong, are prone to go astray by imitating the violent behaviours and committing real violent crimes as they regard the violence as reasonable and justifiable.

On the other hand, media, such as TV or film, is considered as the correct information source regulated by the government. It should be reporting and reflecting true phenomenon in the society. Violence, as one of the facts in the real world, certainly has to be reported. However, excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public and exert detrimental influence to the society as well. It is recently reported in the news that a seventeen-year-old boy killed all his family members, one sister and two parents out of hatred and jealousy. In the real world, we are inclined to take extreme approach to tackle a small problem due to excessive violence exposure.

We cannot deny that our society is occupied with the violent scenes and plots at present.

"It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy. In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.

First of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.

On the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.

Consequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.",Should students be taught to compete or to cooperate?,4.0,367.0,16.0,22.9375,58.0,10.0,14.625,191.0,0.2370572207084468,0.1171662125340599,0.0790190735694822,0.0572207084468664,0.0217983651226158,9.0,0.0666666666666666,5.438,0.4313725490196078,365.0,164.87366699951997,0.0,0.0,164.87366699951997,12.2,13.3,10.97,4.079671304966378,0.215,0.024,0.761,46.0,7.0,0.5735294117647058,6,3,2,0.0
"Crime is always punishable. Retribution is the method for countering criminals. Some countries have stringent rules, like capital punishment, while other have a lot of flexibility in the judicial system. However, strict laws, like capital punishment, are essential in a society.

Capital punishment is given only in the "" rarest of the rare"" cases. Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings. When a criminal becomes a threat to the society, such that they can commit heinous crimes, then they are given capital punishment. Thus, capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals.

Moreover, capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes. When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment, they will fear and not commit such crimes. Thus, the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased.

Importantly, capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals. Criminals who don't have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are, therefore, given capital punishment.

However, the jury giving the verdict are also humans. They have the life of a person at their discretion. They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals. The jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime. For example, if an individual murders someone for self-defence, then such a crime is not heinous. Only deserving criminals, who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment.

Capital punishment is essential to control violence in the society. I firmly believe that psychopaths, terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment. Capital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner. However, it should be considered as the last option by the jury and all circumstances must be taken into account before pronouncing the final verdict.",capital punishment..necessary or not,6.0,321.0,23.0,13.956521739130435,25.0,4.0,7.043478260869565,176.0,0.2959501557632398,0.1183800623052959,0.1308411214953271,0.0373831775700934,0.0218068535825545,13.0,0.08125,4.696,0.4592391304347826,316.0,122.55464949353042,0.0,0.0,122.55464949353042,9.9,11.2,12.93,3.872591874605263,0.118,0.299,0.583,43.0,2.0,0.4402173913043478,0,0,1,0.0
"Many people believe that the life in a major metropolis is convenient and interesting. Personally, however, I am in favor of living in a small town. The atmosphere in suburban area brings me peaceful feeling. Moreover, people there are very friendly. Finally, the environmental is greener than in cities. That is why I love enjoying my life in a small town.

First and foremost, peaceful atmosphere is attractive. It is clearly seen that people in large cities face annoying noise and dirty air emitted from vehicles almost everyday. This is likely to adversely affect their mental health. Meanwhile, lives small towns are great deal more quiet and the air is always fresh. These features make a suburban town the paradise for people who want to escape from suffocating lives in major cities.

Secondly, people in small towns are always friendly. In my experience, many people in urban areas even do not know the names of their neighbors. It is contrary in small town life, where people are ready to help whenever their neighbors are in need. The relationship among them can be so close that they usually attend the birthday party of one of their neighboring people. The affection from people around brings me cozy feeling on my birthday when I live away from my family.

Finally, the green environment in small towns interests me. It seems to me that there are more trees and lakes in towns than in cities. It is wonderful that I get up early in the morning and take a walk in such a green place. The urban environment, however, is so artificial with only buildings and vehicles. I can not adapt myself to such an environment.

"Nowadays, whether to establish large factories nearby housing areas has become a controversial issue in our society. Out of the case of economic development, industrial buildings are a necessary part of modern society. However a vast number of people are against building a factory near their community because of pollution. From my point of view, the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages, if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories.

First of all, a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate. To manufacture goods, there must be the demand of laborers, from which the local residents can benefit. What is more, the factory is not isolated, other industries and business will be quickly established, resulting in economic growth of local area. For example, the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers' accommodation need.

The main disadvantage is contamination. It is truth that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry, such as water pollution, overcrowded traffic and medical problems. For instance, in some industrial cities , a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems, such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances.

However, it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society. Therefore, how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it. In fact most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well.

In conclusion, installation of manufacturing plant is a trend of industrialization for many countries. Its advantages will outweigh disadvantages as long as the factories dispose their waste and pollution in the correct way.",Influence Of Large Factory,5.0,298.0,16.0,18.625,32.0,5.0,9.5625,180.0,0.2818791946308724,0.1375838926174496,0.1208053691275167,0.023489932885906,0.0369127516778523,5.0,0.0347222222222222,5.625,0.5075075075075075,289.0,115.59539570604534,1.0,-0.0025619448873684,115.59283376115796,11.7,13.2,13.29,4.135037468112996,0.116,0.134,0.75,34.0,5.0,0.4594594594594595,0,0,1,0.0
"Persistent deliberation is happening as to whether it is desirable for the youth to go to university. In regard to the development of the country, some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education in universities, while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment. In this essay, I will analyze both views first in order to come up with a fool-proof decision.

To begin with, those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons. From their point of view, the fact is that there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation, such as mechanics, sales persons, or engineers, and, furthermore, labors for graduates are in short supply. What is worse, the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying. In this regard it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs, even can be a sheer time-consuming.

However, on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition, saying that universities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge for the human race, such as bio science, politics, and medicine. These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world. More importantly, many researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society. Another significant factor of universities is that diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently because there are a number of chances through internships, deeper discussion, independent life, and exchange scholarships.

To sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities' education have reasonable justifications; however, I agree with the latter view. Although higher education does not guarantee young students' success, the benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges.",Young people should go to university or not,4.0,346.0,13.0,26.615384615384617,42.0,11.0,14.461538461538462,206.0,0.3092485549132948,0.0751445086705202,0.1127167630057803,0.0346820809248554,0.0086705202312138,5.0,0.031055900621118,8.0,0.5193798449612403,343.0,141.97528943612303,2.0,-0.1963244270762815,141.77896500904674,14.8,17.2,13.52,4.503900685377524,0.119,0.021,0.86,52.0,0.0,0.4857881136950904,0,0,1,0.0
"Most people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject, while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional. In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides.

It is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology. Therefore, many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music. I have an impression that students, who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time. In this case, music can be a useful and interesting solution. Moreover, if musical activity involves many participants, there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group, which is, of course, beneficial in their future life. In fact, students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music. Consequently, the calm atmosphere in the class might be created.

By contrast, it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students. In our hectic life, however, demand is not for musically orientated students, but for academically developed employees. Hence, I agree with the majority, because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it. Increasingly however, students can not obtain supposed impacts, unless they get interested in it more seriously. Therefore, music and other entertaining subjects should be optional. Nowadays, time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace. To my mind, students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects, rather than playing on guitar or singing a song.

In conclusion, I think that in order to be a competitive worker, students must know their field in an advanced level. On the other hand, music can help an individual to shape its character. An integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory.",Should high school make music lessons compulsory,4.0,334.0,19.0,17.57894736842105,31.0,9.0,9.526315789473683,207.0,0.2604790419161676,0.1467065868263473,0.1137724550898203,0.0419161676646706,0.0419161676646706,11.0,0.0709677419354838,5.211,0.525065963060686,332.0,138.24548458263368,0.0,0.0,138.24548458263368,10.2,11.5,11.31,4.305324412827647,0.185,0.021,0.794,52.0,0.0,0.4775725593667546,0,0,1,0.0
"Artists in most countries are given the freedom to express their thoughts in whatever they do. Nevertheless, some argue that there should be government restrictions in order to limit their opinions. I however, agree to this only to a certain extent and believe that the artists must be given freedom so that they will produce some really marvelous masterpiece.

First and foremost, if there is control over artists' ideas, they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run. It is undeniable that when they are given the opportunity to express themselves, most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies. For example, paintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times. In short, without any limitations, there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists.

Furthermore, it is every human's right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation. Today, many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries. Arts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country. To illustrate this further, the famous movie '3 Idiots' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn. Thus, human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely.

Looking from another perspective, there are certain drawbacks if artists are not restricted. They might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country. To cite an example, Malaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace. In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races, this might end up in some chaos among the society. Nonetheless, I believe that artists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts.

To conclude, it is now evident that there should not be any restrictions on artists' work. Allowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves as ideas can naturally flow when there are no limitations. Hence, even though freedom to express ideas can bring some negative effects, I certainly believe that there are many wonderful and beautiful Arts due to the freedom to express ideas and thus, I strongly believe there should be no restrictions on them.",Artists' freedom to express ideas,5.0,441.0,20.0,22.05,42.0,13.0,12.9,241.0,0.2018140589569161,0.1609977324263038,0.0680272108843537,0.0702947845804988,0.0362811791383219,8.0,0.0434782608695652,6.15,0.4753086419753086,430.0,198.89227426433507,5.0,-0.2445699599520511,198.647704304383,10.7,13.0,10.91,4.551570868813671,0.176,0.052,0.771,62.0,6.0,0.5308641975308642,0,0,1,0.0
"Creativity is the ability to think beyond the obvious. Many governments restrict the artistic works of the creative minds. Creativity originates in a free mind. Hence, creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions.

Time and again, creative artists like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, Shakespeare etc. have made artistic works which gave a social message. Right from sculptures to paintings, books to drama and movies, all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras. Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message.

Nonetheless, innovative works makes people realise things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience. It helps to raise issues and criticise the wrong doings of the governments. For instance, Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government, just because she raised a social issue. This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds. In addition, creativity also gives aesthetic charm.

Unfortunately, many governments restrict the artists. Frank Zappa once said, "" Mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if its not open."" Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains. Like the media, artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely.

However, artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people. Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people. Artists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar, hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose. I firmly believe that artists should be given the freedom of expression. Mind can not work when it is chained in boundaries. Imagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws.",creativity-should it be given freedom or restrictions,5.0,310.0,23.0,13.478260869565217,23.0,6.0,6.173913043478261,181.0,0.2548387096774193,0.1516129032258064,0.1225806451612903,0.0161290322580645,0.0258064516129032,8.0,0.0473372781065088,4.682,0.5113636363636364,300.0,124.8920299801802,3.0,-0.3751358362240293,124.5168941439562,7.3,10.2,12.06,4.0416163690950695,0.239,0.074,0.687,39.0,7.0,0.4034090909090909,8,4,2,0.0
"Recently, the controversial debate surrounding universities has sparked interests among students and the media. Some of them deem universities principally provide training for people to be qualified employees. However, others support that it is more reasonable to set down universities as a centre of culture life where knowledge is transferred and updated. This essay will argue that the main functions of universities as the highest educational institution are teaching and researching.

Firstly, imparting knowledge and educating people are basic duty of universities where people decide career direction and acquire more specialized knowledge and skills. Systematic and comprehensive training programs in specific fields urge people to master information required quickly and thoroughly. Nevertheless, universities are not only continuation of schooling but a platform where people start knowing more about society. The essential social capabilities such as communication skills, teamwork, leadership and time management are gradually cultivated with group workshops and various kinds of social activities in universities.

Secondly, universities playing the most important role in education system have to guarantee the knowledge conveyed is true and useful, which can be achieved through the researching function. Old knowledge is applied to particular problems during research and solutions found often bring about innovations in culture and technology to promote human and communities to step forward.

In conclusion, it can be seen that universities produce a great many of talents with outstanding teaching and advance the progress of human society with achievements in scientific research. Both teaching and researching working together lead to the success of today's universities.",teaching and researching working together lead to the success,4.0,254.0,12.0,21.166666666666668,29.0,13.0,9.166666666666666,166.0,0.3110236220472441,0.1496062992125984,0.1102362204724409,0.0118110236220472,0.0118110236220472,10.0,0.0689655172413793,6.0,0.5942028985507246,251.0,99.3130957742861,0.0,0.0,99.3130957742861,15.1,17.7,17.29,4.319037967636552,0.17,0.023,0.807,39.0,0.0,0.3985507246376811,0,0,1,0.0
"Education is important for the development of the world. Its a debatable issue whether universities should accept equal number of males and females in a course or not. However, since both genders are equally important, both must be given equal opportunities. Universities must admit both in equal numbers, depending on their choices.

Right to education is a basic human right of both, males and females. The whole world aims for women empowerment, and to achieve this, females should be given equal opportunities as males. When universities will accept them in equal number, both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop.

Co-education helps both genders to gel well with each other. It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together. For example, students studying in boy's colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them. On the other hand, females studying in girl's colleges are too shy to face boys. Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both. Universities giving both genders equal opportunities, will prepare then for future challenges and will help in the long run.

Unfortunately, some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields, like maths, mechanical engineering, defence etc. This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society. Time and again, women have proved their mettle in every field. Women like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Mari Curie etc., are symbols of women's intelligence and skills.

Thus, I firmly believe that both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers. Equality in education will help in development of the society.Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior. Choice of course should be the discretion of the student and their merit, irrespective of the gender.

"In our world today, there is a wide variety of museums where people can travel to and see differently interesting things. Some people state that visiting museums is only a form of recreation; others disagree, arguing that museums play a role in education. In fact, each of these arguments has its own validity.

Firstly, museums such as art and music can offer people with a wide range of entertainment activities. For example, they often organise traditional music events performed by local or other famous artists that people can attend to and enjoy to some extent. Another point is that many visitors nowadays may choose to come to museums just for pleasure or as one of the activities that they take part in their holiday trips. This, therefore, makes museums a place to entertain in people leisure time.

On the other hand, the establishment of a particular museum like history, science, or oceanography is usually attached to educational purposes. As can be seen, school and university students and teachers are always the guests of museums because the places are where they can discover and obtain a large amount of information related to their studies and teaching. In addition, there are a number of seminars and conferences held at museums that are informative and necessary for scholars and experts in their fields of research. In this way, museums prove the supporting role in human education.

In conclusion, visiting museums is clearly seen as both means of entertainment and education. However, from my viewpoint, people should perceive the value of museums in enhancing their own knowledge about the world they live in.",Museums as a form of entertainment or education?,4.0,269.0,13.0,20.692307692307693,37.0,10.0,10.846153846153848,164.0,0.3159851301115242,0.137546468401487,0.0669144981412639,0.0223048327137546,0.0260223048327137,11.0,0.0859375,6.923,0.5484949832775919,263.0,111.11245416093126,2.0,-0.0640422975855806,111.04841186334568,11.4,12.8,11.49,4.2004549215134,0.13,0.029,0.842,45.0,2.0,0.471571906354515,0,0,1,0.0
"How to allocate governmental budget efficiently has always been a hot topic of discussion among the public. Recently, some people argue that government should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities. As far as I am concerned, this proposal is beneficial more to the society.

Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums. As a matter of fact, an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals, whereas a physical damaged person, resulting from the lack of medical treatment, may no longer participate in any sports games. Therefore, providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government.

Entertaining facilities such as cinemas, theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented. Their existences are based on their marketing strategies, the condition of facilities and the volume of audience. The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market, which should not be interfered by government. Instead, the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits, which deserves more funds from government.

Furthermore, putting taxpayers' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them. For example, not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot. Therefore, it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens' tax funds to meet a minority of people's needs. That is the reason why sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support, because they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis.

To summarize, I strongly agree that budgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities, because the former is more essential, non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens.",government shouldn't put money on building theaters or sports stadiums,5.0,324.0,15.0,21.6,42.0,12.0,11.266666666666667,185.0,0.2808641975308642,0.1296296296296296,0.1018518518518518,0.0246913580246913,0.0216049382716049,6.0,0.0377358490566037,6.067,0.4861878453038674,323.0,127.58971420415608,0.0,0.0,127.58971420415608,14.1,14.9,13.4,4.269182752984503,0.148,0.059,0.793,45.0,0.0,0.4668508287292817,12,6,2,0.0
"Nowadays, the world includes developing countries and developed countries. The difference between them is amount of money that governments use in critical areas such as commerce, health, education. The poor countries are buried in debts which are caused by loans they borrowed from The World Bank and the rich countries. To ease this difference and help the less fortune countries, the richer countries should take efforts in improving important areas in the less fortune countries.

Most of the people in African and poor countries live in difficult conditions because of their countries locate in areas where lack of natural resources and have bad weather conditions for development as well. In these countries, citizens are in need for foods, corrupt and unemployment rate is at high level, the consequences of AIDS are devastating quickly. These problems will be dealt with if the richer countries agree to help by donating free drugs for the inflected population, sending doctors and nurses to treat and educate those in need, teaching the inflected citizens how to prevent this disease spread.

Furthermore, most economies of developing countries depends on exporting raw material and agricultural products as rice, corn. Then, they buy industrialized products from developed countries which result in financial deficit. This made poor countries have to borrow significant amount of money from World Bank which they can not repay even interest. Sometimes, the money disappears without any impact. Regarding to this issue, the G8 which include eight richest countries decided to forgive billions of dollars in debts owned by poor countries.

In conclusion, the rich countries play an important role in helping poor countries develop important areas such as trade, health and education.

"The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries. People moved due to a number of reasons, namely better educations or higher salary jobs. Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries' cultures. However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values.

Firstly, maintaining one's cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments. Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues. Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values. These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one's pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more. Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential.

Secondly, it is crucial to keep one's identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin. For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home. Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism. Hence, it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important.

To conclude, although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one's cultural values to adapt in the new cultures. As far as I am concerned, sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society.",More people are migrating to other countries than ever before,4.0,323.0,16.0,20.1875,32.0,14.0,10.0625,191.0,0.2383900928792569,0.1857585139318885,0.1238390092879257,0.0526315789473684,0.0185758513931888,6.0,0.036144578313253,6.25,0.5266106442577031,322.0,135.42550111405214,1.0,-0.0243730611375305,135.4011280529146,11.2,13.3,12.53,4.185040228606352,0.19,0.039,0.771,38.0,3.0,0.4509803921568627,0,0,1,0.0
"It is every student's desire to study at a good university and experience a new environment. While some students study and live overseas to achieve this, some prefer to study home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas. In my opinion, one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons.

First, studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures. Compared to the peers studying in the home country, it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself/herself into new environments and situations in life.

Second, living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet. One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness, living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life. Moreover, the one will learn living without depending on anyone else.

Also, employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills. Becoming successful in this study will give the student an edge in job market. Therefore, one who has studied and lived overseas will become more eligible for the job than his/her peers.

"There is not a single piece of history that determines whether or not same sex marriage is right or wrong. There is absolutely no legal, logical, or governing reason that same sex couples cannot be wed and it's extremely unconstitutional in every way to tell them they can't. Same sex marriage should be legal for a number of reasons, a few being, it's no one else's business if two men or two women want to get married, not allowing them to marry makes them seem inferior, and it rids them of their civil rights.

In the book Gay marriage by Kate Burns, it states ""Who owns marriage? In other words, who defines marriage? Who allows marriage, and who enforces it?"" (22) It's wrong to tell two people who love each other that they cannot marry; it's nobody's business who you fall in love with. Just like it is no one's business to tell same sex couples they should not be able wed. Same sex couples just want the benefits of being married like everyone else and there is no proof saying that it is wrong for them to have those benefits. By not allowing them to marry all that America is doing is depriving same sex couples of their rights to care for each other and provide for each other. A common married couple gets benefits on health, gets to make decisions that are best for their spouse in extreme cases, and gets to inherit their spouse's belongings in death. Making same sex marriage illegal also makes the people who are attracted to the same sex feel inferior.

Nobody likes feeling inferior, or like they a below standards, by making sex marriage illegal you are making people who are attracted to the same sex feel and seem inferior to others. Homosexuality is not a conscious choice; it's something they are born with. Just like you didn't choose who you love, neither did they. So it's unfair to make same sex marriage seem inferior when it is no different. In the book Historical Guides to Controversial Issues in America Same-Sex Marriage by Allene Phy-Olsen it states ""Recent decades have seen much interest in the idea of diversity. The argument for same sex marriage asserts that it is hypocritical to deny the full rights and opportunities of citizenship which includes the access to an institution as basic as matrimony"" (76) You would never make a women feel inferior for being a women, so why should you make a man or a women feel like they are less just based on who they love. Same sex marriage being illegal rids the couple of their civil rights.

Civil rights are something people have worked hard to maintain over the years, abolishing slavery and treating women equally. Homosexual couples are no different. They deserve to have their civil rights fulfilled, just like women deserve to vote, they should be allowed to get married. Majority of the population against same sex marriage firmly believe the bible states that it is unholy for couples of the same gender to marry. Many people think that the word of the bible is comparable to law; however we have an amendment which protects our country from that exact situation. In the book The Constitution of the United States of America The Bicentennial keepsake edition, the first amendment provides that ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ..."" (51) The fact that it's in the bible should not dictate the laws against same sex couples becoming wed. Not allowing same sex couples to marry is like saying all people born with a certain hair color should not be allowed marry people of other hair colors, It makes no sense. Laws have been changed for all sexes, races' and genders for the same purpose, equal rights. It is hypocritical to not allow same sex marriage to occur when it appeals to a large growing group of people.

In the end same sex couples are really just couples and should be treated as such. They should be allowed the benefits of marriage, treated equally, not like they are inferior, and same sex couples should be allowed their civil rights. One day in the future this will be achieved.",The Non-Issue of Same Sex Marriage,5.0,714.0,30.0,23.8,88.0,5.0,13.7,310.0,0.211484593837535,0.1624649859943977,0.1120448179271708,0.0910364145658263,0.0210084033613445,19.0,0.0590062111801242,5.154,0.3632958801498127,723.0,317.3897016745328,3.0,-0.2689881447180394,317.12071352981474,10.8,11.8,9.46,4.099557059523565,0.117,0.109,0.773,73.0,25.0,0.5131086142322098,12,6,2,0.0
"It is certainly true that some languages are disappearing day by day over the world. Some people, therefore, harbour a view saying that governments should preserve those by spending some budgets on them. But the others do not believe it is possible. In my opinion, this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly and this essay will discuss this issue.

First and foremost, it is easy to realize that languages, especially oral language, are a quite major part of culture of a country. It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country. The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional, customs and habitants do not exist. Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting. What is more, it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more.

On the other hand, there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages. Although governments invest money on doing that, it is hard to gain the good results. As evidence of this, there are a few people, particularly the youngsters, do not pay attention on collecting and studying those. These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular. In addition, the preservations need a long time to gather, restore all information as well as train in the educational centre. If they do not try their best, their protection can be halted and waste of money.

In a nutshell, I am convinced that all languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible. All people should give a hand to do this better and governments play a vital role on encouraging and distributing those.",Several languages are in danger of extinction,4.0,292.0,17.0,17.176470588235293,26.0,9.0,9.705882352941176,181.0,0.2294520547945205,0.1506849315068493,0.0821917808219178,0.0410958904109589,0.0205479452054794,5.0,0.0393700787401574,5.294,0.5214723926380368,284.0,124.65203853062351,4.0,-0.4479316284829288,124.20410690214058,8.8,10.3,10.21,4.237636040085145,0.218,0.052,0.73,35.0,1.0,0.5061349693251533,0,0,1,0.0
"""A picture is worth a thousand words"" is a popular maxim that is being used for a very long time. This strongly depicts the power of images in conveying messages, ideas, or opinions to people. Nevertheless, the importance of written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication that is commonly used. Hence, I agree only to certain degree that in today's world, image serves as a more effective means of communication.

Firstly, pictures can influence the way people think. For example, nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking. As a result, statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers, indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit. Not only that, the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter, which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan. Apart from that, images are also widely used in newspapers, magazines and advertisements. Thus, it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many.

Looking from another perspective, written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages. With only pictures, everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images. Nonetheless, this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about. Furthermore, the primary way of educating students is also by this way. Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better.

To conclude, both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect, either images or words. Hence, for a more meaningful communication, these two elements have their respective roles to play: image to exemplify and words to describe a particular subject.",Is image more powerful than the written word?,4.0,311.0,17.0,18.294117647058822,31.0,8.0,9.647058823529411,195.0,0.2540192926045016,0.1382636655948553,0.0771704180064308,0.0257234726688102,0.0128617363344051,8.0,0.0536912751677852,5.471,0.5352112676056338,307.0,123.11180559194752,2.0,-0.0671046206668456,123.04470097128066,10.4,12.2,12.07,4.333377610860749,0.153,0.045,0.802,49.0,2.0,0.4619718309859155,0,0,1,0.0
"Universities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise. Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts: where more and more is known about less and less. Nevertheless, among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life. However, although I respect the universities' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause, I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university.

A university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge. What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for, not the employers, as students are the ones here to seek knowledge. High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons: a degree that's more widely accepted, gain knowledge and insight into an industry, or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field.

On the other hand, universities and be regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather. It is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university, but instead, these must be made available when needed. So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information, rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers' taste.

In conclusion, the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources. It would be helpful, however, if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures.",True Function of A University,4.0,306.0,12.0,25.5,38.0,15.0,14.0,183.0,0.2549019607843137,0.1405228758169934,0.088235294117647,0.0261437908496732,0.0163398692810457,5.0,0.0357142857142857,6.667,0.5190615835777126,304.0,134.0626190645811,0.0,0.0,134.0626190645811,13.2,15.8,12.48,4.1793865897177325,0.097,0.013,0.89,49.0,0.0,0.4926686217008797,0,0,1,0.0
"With the booming development of some cosmopolitan metropolises in recent years, an increasing number of people are flooding into these major cities, raising such urban problems as traffic jams or housing shortage. In such cases, some people think an effective way to tackle these problems is to relocate big firms, factories and their employees in cities to the countryside. However, from my perspective, I suppose this suggestion is not advisable, for it cannot alter the situation essentially and instead it may give rise to new concerns in rural areas.

Admittedly, moving big companies, factories and their employees to the rural area can help ease traffic congestion and housing scarcity. As people work in the countryside, they will not have to commute in cities at peak times such as eight o'clock in the morning or six o'clock in the afternoon. Consequently, urban traffic jam can be, to some extent, relieved in this respect. On the other hand, the relocation of companies and factories in cities may leave more space to build new residential areas, thus alleviating the urban housing crisis at present.

However, the proposed measure is not fundamental to resolve urban traffic and housing problems. This is because some employees are reluctant to live in the rural areas only due to the relocation of their workplaces. This can be best illustrated with the example of the married workers. Taking into the growth of their children into consideration, the married workers may believe the educational resources in cities are far superior to ones in the countryside, and because of this, they probably opt for living in the cities. Thus, these employers have to commute between the cities and the countryside, which is ineffective in tackling traffic and housing problems. What is worse, the workers have to consume more time and traffic fees.

Also, the suggested step can bring about environmental problems in the rural areas. As companies and factories move to the countryside, they may deplete the local natural resources as the raw materials for production. Besides, the untreated pollutants the plants discharge can be damaging to the rural environment .Therefore, moving companies, factories and employees to the rural areas can ruin the environment there.

Overall, I would conclude that relocating big firms, factories and their employees is not sensible to address urban traffic and housing problems. Instead, the government should be forward-looking, resolving the problems within the cities.",Solve traffic and housing problems by moving companies to the rural areas?,5.0,398.0,18.0,22.11111111111111,39.0,12.0,11.11111111111111,200.0,0.2839195979899497,0.135678391959799,0.1105527638190954,0.0201005025125628,0.0351758793969849,8.0,0.04,5.722,0.4263392857142857,393.0,153.5775250012094,0.0,0.0,153.5775250012094,11.4,14.0,12.71,4.240405706658717,0.076,0.095,0.829,57.0,4.0,0.4464285714285714,6,3,2,0.0
"The purpose of this essay is to discuss what can students and the organizations benefit from the activity that the students sent by their schools to work for companies without salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the advantages for doing this for both students and companies, and then I would draw a conclusion at the end.

To begin with, students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to. In most school curriculums, the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom. As a result, students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation. For this reason, the internship, although without pay, can give them the experiences that money cannot buy.

As for the companies, the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money. In addition, the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination, which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan. Moreover they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training, therefore save the time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation.

To sum up, students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say.",Benefits of students' unpaid work,4.0,270.0,10.0,27.0,51.0,13.0,15.1,158.0,0.2481481481481481,0.1814814814814815,0.074074074074074,0.0444444444444444,0.0518518518518518,8.0,0.0666666666666666,7.2,0.5204081632653061,266.0,112.75289950210932,1.0,-0.0380992718389808,112.71480023027034,13.8,15.9,11.9,4.143986471183045,0.108,0.012,0.88,49.0,3.0,0.5136054421768708,0,0,1,0.0
"During the history of the world, every change has its own positive and negative sides. Globalization as a gradual change affecting all over the world is not an exception. Although it has undeniable effects on the economics of the world; it has side effects which make it a controversial issue.

Some people prefer to recognize globalization as a threat to ethnic and religious values of people of their country. They think that the idea of globalization put their inherited culture in danger of uncontrolled change and make them vulnerable against the attack of imperialistic governments.

Those who disagree, believe that globalization contribute effectively to the global improvement of the world in many aspects. Developing globalization, people can have more access to many natural resources of the world and it leads to increasing the pace of scientific and economic promotions of the entire world. In addition, they admit that globalization can be considered a chance for people of each country to promote their lifestyle through the stuffs and services imported from other countries.

Moreover, the proponents of globalization idea point out globalization results in considerable decrease in global tension due to convergence of benefits of people of the world which is a natural consequence of globalization.

In conclusion, I would rather classify myself in the proponents of globalization as a speeding factor of global progress. I think it is more likely to solve the problems of the world rather than intensifying them.

"A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible, or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees. From my perspective, online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions.

To begin with, distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world. In earlier times, students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby, regardless of any differences in teaching facilities, teacher's qualifications or the school reputation. Now, however, students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide. Furthermore, the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students. Consequently, educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios. Thanks to the economical online-teaching, universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains.

Nevertheless, opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates. They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life. It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive.

By way of conclusion, it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases. However, discussions and interactions should be held via video conferencing frequently so that the joy of learning would not be diminished",distance-learning vs. attending school in person,4.0,285.0,13.0,21.923076923076923,46.0,12.0,10.692307692307692,181.0,0.3473684210526316,0.1298245614035087,0.0947368421052631,0.0175438596491228,0.0245614035087719,7.0,0.0443037974683544,7.0,0.5705128205128205,293.0,115.81034231128451,0.0,0.0,115.81034231128451,14.2,17.9,16.88,4.347464602268885,0.132,0.016,0.851,47.0,1.0,0.4455128205128205,0,0,1,0.0
"Many people believe that children should study at school to have more knowledge that prepare better for their future. Others, however, think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job. Personally, I tend to agree with the point of view that student have to be forced to study at school.

First of all, schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying. It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things. Second of all, schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students. Students may learn professional skills, expand their understandings and gain experiences. Therefore, they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future. For example, as we know, employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills.

Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job. Whether children can learn a lot at school, there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. Furthermore, children can learn social skills when they have a job. They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school. Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they've earned.

Overall, I believe that students should study at school. Even though there are some advantages of leaving school to find a job, studying at school is always the best choice for children's future. There are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job.",Study at school or get a job?,4.0,301.0,17.0,17.705882352941178,27.0,9.0,9.352941176470589,154.0,0.2524916943521594,0.1893687707641196,0.0797342192691029,0.0531561461794019,0.0431893687707641,11.0,0.0763888888888889,5.235,0.4401197604790419,297.0,134.68655549051056,2.0,-0.2382963113206885,134.44825917918988,7.8,10.7,10.5,3.7232123764307934,0.11,0.038,0.852,28.0,3.0,0.4760479041916167,0,0,1,0.0
"With the rapid growth of technologies and global market development, worldwide travelling has not been so accessible than before. Despite it is profoundly beneficial for those desire to explore the world, it is also a controversial argument that drawbacks can be seen as a result of unnecessarily frequent travel. Personally I believe negative impacts brought up by international journey outweigh its benefits.

First of all, due to the dramatic drop of travelling cost on airfare and accommodation, overseas visits are more feasible nowadays which effectively accelerate worldwide economic growth. However, excessive travels may also result in unhealthy development of certain markets. We can observe all over the globe that popular cities over relay on tourists related businesses and undermine the market diversity. One obvious example is the streets of Hong Kong overloaded with pharmacies and souvenir shops. The overall market environment becomes increasingly difficult for other businesses. At the end the city will suffer from the monotonous development and lose the attraction.

Further and even more importantly, one of the largest fossil fuel consumptions in the world is airlines business. It is believed that uncontrolled global trips should take a critical responsibility in our environmental pollution. Imagine how luxury it is for a weekend trip decades ago, yet it is now affordable almost for everyone with low cost flights and AirBnB. With the extra help of internet, travel lovers can even lockdown their journey solely at their fingertips. This is the reason why scientists attribute this overwhelming travel trend to the irreversible damage to our planet.

In conclusion, overseas travelling is an irresistible trend for the majority which also helps in globalization. On the other hand, yet, I agree the trend also leads to more serious damages on our cultural and natural environments. It is important for all humility to get an optimal balance between economic development and environmental responsibilities.",International tourism is now more common than ever before (against),4.0,310.0,17.0,18.23529411764705,30.0,10.0,9.058823529411764,209.0,0.2580645161290322,0.1,0.1387096774193548,0.032258064516129,0.0193548387096774,4.0,0.0256410256410256,6.188,0.6035502958579881,303.0,119.47627274407068,1.0,-0.1004712685595307,119.37580147551114,12.7,13.8,14.39,4.512624991616458,0.14,0.113,0.747,42.0,3.0,0.4556213017751479,0,0,1,0.0
"Camping can take on many definitions. Camping to one person can mean seclusion in the middle of a forest. Another individual might think camping as a motor home with all the amenities of their house, including the kitchen sink. Whatever the definition is, camping is an experience that should be tried by everyone.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has posted on their website, epa.gov/iaq/pubs/insidest.html, that approximately 90% of a person's life is spent indoors. The same article goes on to state ""In the last several years, a growing body of scientific evidence has indicated that the air within homes and other buildings can be more seriously polluted than the outdoor air in even the largest and most industrialized cities."" Spending time camping is a great way to revitalize the lungs. The phrase ""city air"" often is thought as air that is polluted, while ""country air"" is often used to describe clean, healthy air. Breathing the country air usually makes a person feel revitalized. There is no better way to receive the country air than while camping.

Another great part about camping is being outside under the sun. The sun rays help the human body with the production of vitamin D. In fact, other than popping a vitamin pill, the only way that a body can produce vitamin D is through the exposure to the sun. Feeling the warm rays of the sun hit the face is always a welcome sensation. Being outside in the sun is another great advantage of camping.

With the recent downturn of the economy, people are always trying to find ways to have fun at a relative inexpensive cost. Camping is a great way to have fun while keeping the overall cost down. A one night stay at Sands of Time RV Park costs twenty two dollars a night. That fee includes water, sewer, and electric. A stay in a condo in the same area will cost at least $645.00 for the week. A condo will cost the family $491 more than a campsite. That difference in price can make a camping trip a good possibility while keeping the overall costs down to a minimum.

Camping gives anyone the possibility to go places that they have never been before. Camping can take you to Yosemite, or into the Band Lands of South Dakota. Camping can also take place at a nearby state park. No matter where the campsite is, a camper can feel miles away from the city. There are so many places both near and far that are best experienced by spending a few days within the place. Camping gives you the ability to see these beautiful locations at first sunlight, in the middle of the day, at sunset and even under the stars. It can be amazing how different the same object can look throughout the day.

Campers often express how a feeling comes over their body when they reach the moment when the day to day turmoil leaves their body. Virtually every camper experiences this moment. This is specifically when they are experiencing nature and the realization is made how much simpler life is when outside with nature. Returning to nature often allows campers to return to their true selves. It is this discovery that should be experienced by all.

The benefits of camping can also be seen in families. Some people that do not like the idea of camping give the reason of having to camp with people in such a confined space. It this confined space that, when allowed, can create a close bond between family members. When families go camping, they put the jobs and sporting events on hold. There are usually no video games being played, no soccer practice to drive to, and no business projects to worry about. By putting aside all of these events, the family has an opportunity to bond and renew their relationships. Some of this may be foreign to some people and there can be resistance. When this resistance is put aside, these bonds will be renewed. Camping is a great way to bring families together and strengthen their love.

Food is always a item that people cannot do without. Campers have an opportunity to try some interesting food. Cooking over a fire makes burgers and potatoes taste better than can be found at any fast food place. Campers need to think out their meals thoroughly prior to making a trip. These well planned meals are sometimes the best meals that campers have ever had. Cooking a chicken over campfire, cooking an apple pie in a dutch oven, and cooking a burger wrapped in foil on the coals of a camp fire can put the best gourmet chefs to shame. Perhaps it is the fresh smoke, the clean air or just the fact that a camper's senses are heightened. Whatever the reasons are, food always tastes better when camping.

Some of the people that can be met while camping can make the entire trip better. Campers can come from every state, and sometimes different countries. Taking a simple walk around the campsite, the camper can encounter these people and hear the most amazing stories. Campers are friendly and enjoy the company of fellow campers. Kids always seem to find new ""best friends"" for the weekends and even adults may find themselves sharing a meal with their new neighbors.

Sometimes camping can also make campers realize the overlooked luxuries that they experience day to day. Flush toilets, warm showers, central heating and air, and even the lack of bugs accompanying the sleeping camper are some of the luxuries that are missed the most. A small weekend away from these luxuries can make the campers realize how lucky they are in their day to day living.

Camping is one of the most basic and enjoyable activities that can be experienced by all. Camping has no requirements other than willing participants. Camping doesn't discriminate, doesn't have deadlines and has nothing but fun around each corner. No matter if the camping is experienced in a tent or in a luxury camper, getting outside, in the wilderness can provide a lifetime of memories. Camping has something for everyone.",Everyone Should Go Camping,11.0,1029.0,63.0,16.333333333333332,45.0,5.0,8.857142857142858,489.0,0.2672497570456754,0.1477162293488824,0.0699708454810495,0.021379980563654,0.0310981535471331,14.0,0.0292887029288702,4.969,0.3945756780402449,1019.0,425.4133041864212,2.0,-0.0680441253061713,425.34526006111497,7.0,8.5,9.05,4.756260927130772,0.103,0.031,0.866,95.0,7.0,0.4881889763779528,6,2,3,0.0
"With the rapid development of the standard of people's life, increasing numbers of animal experiments are done, new medicines and foods, for instance. Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature, however, I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals. In my essay, I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects.

First of all, as we all know, animals are friendly and vital for people, because if there are no animals in the world, the balance of nature will broke down, and we, human, will die out as well. The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals. In other words, doing this various testing is a hazard of human's future and next generation.

Though animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance, it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life. To begin with, it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious, and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying. The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human's life. Thus even if they are volunteers; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines. Furthermore, it also have potentially harm for human's health without any testing.

To sum up, I reaffirm that although there is some disadvantages of animals' profits, the merits of animal experiments still outweigh the demerits.",Using animals for the benefit of the human beings,4.0,271.0,12.0,22.58333333333333,43.0,11.0,12.75,163.0,0.2656826568265683,0.1328413284132841,0.0959409594095941,0.055350553505535,0.029520295202952,7.0,0.056910569105691,5.667,0.5,271.0,111.04586547389653,1.0,-0.0265785830546545,111.01928689084184,12.1,12.8,10.39,3.983191385341992,0.087,0.111,0.802,39.0,9.0,0.4935483870967742,2,1,2,0.0
"The last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists travelling to visit natural wonder sights, ancient heritages and different cultures around the world. While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries, I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations.

Firstly, international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country's economy in order to serve various demands of tourists. Take Cambodia for example, a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops and other stores. These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard. Therefore tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country.

Secondly, through tourism industry, many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected. For instance, in Vietnam, many cultural costumes and natural scenes, namely 'Trong Dong' drum performance and 'Ha Long' bay, are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry. Without this support and profit from tourism, many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works. Thus, tourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes.

To conclude, as far as I am concerned, international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries. In addition, the authorities should adequately support these sustainable developments.",International tourism is now more common than ever before (for),4.0,251.0,12.0,20.916666666666668,39.0,10.0,8.833333333333334,166.0,0.3147410358565737,0.1394422310756972,0.1354581673306772,0.0119521912350597,0.0159362549800796,8.0,0.0544217687074829,5.083,0.5830388692579506,246.0,95.52386506470398,1.0,-0.1107116675454079,95.41315339715858,12.6,16.8,16.07,4.189363961726468,0.19,0.044,0.765,33.0,5.0,0.3745583038869258,0,0,1,0.0
"Nowadays men and women are equally participating in every field. Contrastingly, in the past time, women worked at home and performed sophisticated work. This factor is still affecting thinking of many people. They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only. This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender.

Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders. Initially, if we look into the fact, women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor. For example, nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky. They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also. Furthermore, university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination. They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission.

However, the current job market affects the decision of universities. Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers. The job selection criteria are pre decided. For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine. They prefer male staff for night shifts. They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling, teaching, designing etc. Therefore, universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender.

To conclude, I strongly believe that universities much open choice for everyone to select his subject. Our youth has become very confident towards his career. They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations. Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer. So we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal.",Gender Equality at university admission,4.0,284.0,23.0,12.347826086956522,20.0,7.0,5.826086956521739,188.0,0.2887323943661972,0.1443661971830986,0.0985915492957746,0.0492957746478873,0.0176056338028169,5.0,0.0333333333333333,4.652,0.5723270440251572,278.0,112.64597502241836,2.0,-0.3487406330665717,112.2972343893518,8.1,9.7,11.82,4.309188386149233,0.103,0.022,0.875,41.0,4.0,0.4213836477987421,0,0,1,0.0
"Games have played a key role in children's growth, especially in terms of their abilities. With technological advances, children have more access to modern games currently. In such case, the relative importance of traditional games and modern games in children's developments of skills has become a frequent topic of discussion. For me, I believe parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games.

It is true that modern games may be, to some extent, beneficial for children to foster some skills, such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend. This is because children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games, which, in fact, helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future. At the same time, children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology, raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative.

However, I think traditional games are still indispensible in children's learning process, even much more essential than modern games, especially in modern society. One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children's communication skills. Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines, traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat, laugh and cooperate face to face. As a result, communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more.

Furthermore, it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today. In fact, these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children's skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices. By contrast, modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits. Therefore, there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents, such as violence or pornography, arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival.

Thus, I would conclude that traditional games should be, by no means, ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games. Only through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process.",Traditional games or modern games in developing children's skills,5.0,359.0,17.0,21.11764705882353,34.0,11.0,10.529411764705882,206.0,0.3008356545961003,0.116991643454039,0.1392757660167131,0.0278551532033426,0.022284122562674,18.0,0.0957446808510638,5.667,0.4877450980392157,361.0,140.98956881036108,1.0,-0.0347668202792943,140.9548019900818,11.5,14.7,13.4,3.972337251681026,0.161,0.039,0.8,51.0,1.0,0.4387254901960784,0,0,1,0.0
"Perhaps, no issue in this world is as significant to people as cooking food, because it affects everybody in their daily lives. Some people hold the opinion that people should spend much time on food. However, I do think that people are likely to spend less time in cooking food. There are various reasons why I maintain this viewpoint, and among those reasons are two important ones.

The first and foremost reason is that with the development of science and technology, more advanced kitchen facilities, such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers, have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time. As a result, people nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two, even three hours like in the last 10 years. Actually, in recent years, there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valueable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework. And this figure still continueously go up along with the improvement of science and technology. Thus, it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future.

Another reason is that most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants because they want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves. According to a recent survey, 89% of people have come to think that, since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures, they have to use a lot of time to work hard, to update themselves, to acquire all kinds of skills and so on. Thus, they find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal. Even they have some spare time, they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study.

Some people may argue that investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family. To some extent, it is true. However, as a matter of fact, using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality. Even, with the help of ozone machines, bacterias, mold spores, or pesticide in vegetables, fruits and foods will be killed and removed, thus health and life of eaters is assured. Besides, along with the high living standard, requirements of quality products in almost restaurants, nowadays, are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities. Consequently, it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality, but do not waste a lot of time.

To sum up, if all those factors are contemplated, it is obviously found that there are many solid reasons to support my viewpoint. So, from what have been discussed above, I strongly affirm the conclusion that people will spend less time in cooking food",people will spend less time on cooking food,5.0,484.0,21.0,23.047619047619047,51.0,6.0,12.761904761904765,261.0,0.262396694214876,0.128099173553719,0.0805785123966942,0.0433884297520661,0.012396694214876,11.0,0.0509259259259259,5.857,0.4456721915285451,477.0,212.3140341429579,0.0,0.0,212.3140341429579,9.9,12.5,9.93,4.391816187579707,0.111,0.03,0.859,75.0,3.0,0.4935543278084714,4,2,2,0.0
"In the present age, it is a matter of fact that increasing minority languages have diminished from the world due to the proliferation of English. Some people claim it's a reasonable loss in globalization while others argue the demerits exceed the merits. Personally, I agree with the former opinion.

No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally. To begin with, communication between countries and cultures become convenient. In my country, English is a required course from elementary school. Thus, studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters. For them, language obstacle is no longer a problem, which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country. This, in turn, enhances relationship and promotes international business. Furthermore, researchers, especially those who work on high-tech, would have wider range of references if they are good at English. Taking IT industry for an example, top technical science is published in English. It's neither to get a translated version of these articles, nor to always have a translator besides. As a result, they have no choice but choosing English as a second language.

Admittedly, opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year. Hence, the culture heritage and nation identity vanish. However, this is really short-sighted, ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society.

In conclusion, in spite of some negative effects, I'm totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around. I suggest all youths should learn English owing to its key role in globalization. But at the same time, actions, like recording, can be taken to protect native languages and cultures.",Influence of English - advantages outweigh the disadvantages,4.0,284.0,19.0,14.947368421052632,25.0,7.0,7.631578947368421,204.0,0.2640845070422535,0.1338028169014084,0.0915492957746478,0.0352112676056338,0.0176056338028169,9.0,0.0620689655172413,4.632,0.6060606060606061,285.0,110.32537596783736,1.0,-0.0265785830546545,110.29879738478272,9.1,11.4,12.4,4.530335007743299,0.105,0.104,0.79,38.0,2.0,0.4393939393939394,0,0,1,0.0
"Nowadays, the importance of vehicles has been widely recognized thoughout the world. However, it rises concerns about the increasingly severe traffic problems as well as the automobile exhaust pollution. Some argue that the best solution to these issues is raising the price of petrol. From my perspective, I think their view is overly simplistic.

Undeniably, making the fuel cost more money could limit the number of vehicles to some extent. Due to the increasing number of petrol stations, the competition in this field is more and more fierce, thus the price of petrol could be lower in the future. Therefore, those who are suffering from the inefficiency of public transport tend to own a car immediately. Moreover, some families purchase even more than three cars just for their own sake. In such case if they must pay more money on fuel, they may consider about that price of purchasing additionally for more time.

Nevertheless, such an argument may restrict the real necessity of automobiles. In fact, some families really need one or two cars. For example, three family members have to work or study in three place separated so far with each other, then they need to acquire at least two cars or they may both be late. On the other hand, the development of automobile industry could be restrained as well as the employments offered by it, which could have negative effects on economy. Therefore, I can hardly agree that the solution is the best.

From my mind, I think there are three ways tosolve these problems. Firstly, a new method of expenditure classification could be adopted. For instance, individuals had to pay much more for fuel if they possess more than three vehicles; secondly, the government should develop the public transport to meet the residents' demand; last but not least, the people should be encouraged to use electric car to reduce the car emissions.

To conclude, I personally believe the government should take some actions such as classifying the payment, boosting the public transport and encouraging individuals to adopt the zero-emission cars, rather than raising the price of petrol, to get rid of the traffic and pollution problems.",Can petrol price increase impact on reducing traffic and pollution?,5.0,360.0,18.0,20.0,48.0,10.0,11.22222222222222,213.0,0.2527777777777777,0.1527777777777778,0.075,0.0361111111111111,0.0361111111111111,4.0,0.0251572327044025,5.0,0.5049261083743842,353.0,149.879970922583,1.0,-0.0433063982533547,149.83666452432965,11.1,12.3,11.14,4.401275354778071,0.084,0.067,0.849,42.0,4.0,0.4975369458128079,2,1,2,0.0
"A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether developments in agriculture are beneficial to humankind, or rather these developments should be allowed to die out just as many inappropriate innovations have in the past. From my perspective, these developments in agricultures should be preserved for the sake of the benefits of all human beings.

To begin with, innovations in agriculture such as mechanized farming and the creations of genetic engineering foods may be the only way to feed the vast number of people in every corner of the world. Imagine the tragedies that would ensue if people lived in famine and started to eat people to survive. Therefore, governments around the world have the obligation to fund in technological developments in farming in order to make an enough production of food for its people. Another reason for applied technology in agriculture is the low-priced foods resulted from the widely used of factory farming. Thanks to the lower expenditure in food consuming, low income people now have sufficient money to cover up costs in health and education.

Nonetheless, opponents of modern technology in agriculture would argue that the proliferation of GE food and factory farming are detrimental to people's health. They further suggest that food which is genetically modified interrupts the natural balance of the ecosystem and would return to haunt us in unexpected ways. In other words, although technological developments in agriculture is beneficial in the short term, its long term negatives are significant.

In reality, of course, the wide spread use of modern technology in agriculture may be problematic in itself; however, given the seriousness of food insufficiency through out the world, I believe this would be the ultimate goal.",pros and cons of developments in agriculture,4.0,285.0,11.0,25.90909090909091,38.0,18.0,13.454545454545457,168.0,0.3017543859649123,0.1157894736842105,0.1052631578947368,0.0140350877192982,0.0280701754385964,6.0,0.0431654676258992,6.636,0.532258064516129,280.0,109.91557398570374,1.0,-0.0272307023196063,109.88834328338412,14.6,16.5,13.23,4.203117272143082,0.067,0.073,0.86,43.0,2.0,0.4774193548387097,2,1,2,0.0
"Since the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized. Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important, whereas, others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong. Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.

First, critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom. This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures. That is because, many zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require. The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment. In addition, sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe.

On the other hand, the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology. Many people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world. Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public. Also, zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life. This is due to the fact that, in zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters. Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced.

In conclusion, both of the arguments have strong supports, but in my own view, more good come from zoos than bad. However, it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention.",Keeping animals in zoos,4.0,325.0,16.0,20.3125,31.0,9.0,11.0,184.0,0.243076923076923,0.1476923076923077,0.1107692307692307,0.0153846153846153,0.0153846153846153,13.0,0.086092715231788,6.062,0.4888268156424581,320.0,134.53114247008116,3.0,-0.3938283021182286,134.13731416796296,11.2,12.7,11.55,3.931861345116713,0.134,0.072,0.794,53.0,3.0,0.4916201117318435,4,2,2,0.0
"Nowadays, the popularity of mobile phones has brought about a lot of convenience but at the meanwhile a variety of problems as well, such as social, medical and technical problems. However, I do not think these disadvantages will outweigh the advantages brought by cell phones. In this essay, I would like to analyse these three issues in order to support my viewpoint.

First of all, almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems. Mobile phones are not out of expectation. Speaking loudly on the phone in public areas, such as schools, libraries and hospitals appears to be very impolite and offensive. What is worse , some students utilize their cell phones as an effective cheating tools in examinations in which they can send and receive answers by texting each other. Nevertheless, it is not impossible to solve these problems, as long as some regulations and rules can be effectively implemented.

It is also worth mentioning that some harmful effects on our health are lethal. It has been proved that overusing of the electronic devices including mobile phones could lead to higher possibility of suffering hearing loss and even cancers, although the further investigation are needed.

Another debatable problem is about techniques. There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party. This possibility exists all the time. But a more efficient and reliable system can also be invented to guarantee the private information of users.

Moreover, the mobile phone has become a dispensable multifunctional tools in people's daily life. Not only used for communication, but it also functions as an Internet browser, a music player , a personal organiser and so forth.

In conclusion, nothing can be overused without side effects. The contribution of the mobile phone to our modern society is prominent and people's dependence on it is irreversible, although it has a number of problems that should be well handled.",Effects of mobile phones,6.0,323.0,18.0,17.944444444444443,31.0,6.0,10.11111111111111,203.0,0.2291021671826625,0.1362229102167182,0.1114551083591331,0.0402476780185758,0.0309597523219814,5.0,0.0354609929078014,5.389,0.5487465181058496,314.0,130.87900558900202,3.0,-0.0713102519133452,130.80769533708866,10.2,12.0,11.89,4.567864959550993,0.119,0.143,0.739,50.0,5.0,0.5069637883008357,0,0,1,0.0
"The modern society is full of cut-throat competition. Some people think that inculcating co-operative approach in a child is essential while some think that competing is the best way to succeed. However, co-operative approach always helps a child to become a responsible adult with good moral values and a friendly social circle.

Co-operation is essential for teamwork. Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children. We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success. A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself. For instance, lions hunt in a team. It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy. In the same way, co-operative approach will save time, energy and will have a higher success rate.

Nevertheless, co-operation helps to understand other's perspective and learn by their mistakes. It helps to identify one's strengths and weaknesses as compared to others. A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people's achievements. However, competition is also as important as co-operation.

Unfortunately, the meaning of competion has been modified in a wrong direction. An individual must compete with oneself only, instead of trying to beat others. Competition has helped the development of science and technology. Competition helps in improvement and evolution. For example, every other day, new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others. This kind of competition gives customers more options.

However, blind and selfish competition is detrimental. 'Your loss, my gain' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run. Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule. A healthy competition which involves raising one's own level above others is the best approach.

Thus, competition and co-operation go hand in hand. These are two sides of the same coin which can't be seperated. I firmly believe that children should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition. They must be made aware of the demerits of selfish competition. When co-operation and healthy competition is followed together, success, achievements, recognition and any goal becomes easier.",competition or co-operation-which is better,6.0,350.0,29.0,12.06896551724138,23.0,5.0,6.206896551724138,216.0,0.3085714285714285,0.1571428571428571,0.1657142857142857,0.0314285714285714,0.0285714285714285,10.0,0.0531914893617021,4.448,0.513715710723192,357.0,137.53471208407748,5.0,-0.213357330714751,137.32135475336273,9.2,10.6,12.75,4.336431418798394,0.245,0.053,0.702,50.0,2.0,0.4488778054862843,0,0,1,0.0
"The differences between knowledge from books and from experience have erupted endless controversy. Various ideas and preferences have been presented. The purpose of my writing is to deeply discuss these sources of knowledge in two important aspects: accuracy and practicability, and to show my greater interest in knowledge accumulated from experience.

First and foremost, the accuracy of knowledge is crucially important. It is apparent that books are often written by professors, experts, or authorities in a variety of fields. Therefore, knowledge acquired from books is greatly accepted, which means that it is right to the bulk of people. Meanwhile, knowledge from experience seems a little different from information contained in books. To cite an example, it is common in books that water boils at 100 Celcius degree. However, the result is not always the same in reality because it also depends on the height, the purity of the water, and even the measuring tool. By and large, each source of knowledge has its own accuracy rate.

Next, the practicability is one of the most essential factors of knowledge. In my experience, information contained in books is usually put in criteria so that many people can read and understand the content. Consequently, it is difficult to apply knowledge from books into practice. Whereas, it is easy to put knowledge from experience in real life because it is acquired from what have happened to them. For instance, a student decides to learn about chemical reactions from books. This method is likely to be fast, simple, and even safe. Nevertheless, there is an increased likelihood that he neither remembers the necessary information for a long time nor knows how to do an make an experiment. Meanwhile, if he goes to the library and carries out the reactions, he is certain to have a thorough grasp of the phenomena seen. He is also able to use this information for the next times. Indeed, knowledge from experience helps people more than knowledge from books does.

In conclusion, I would concede that knowledge from books is widely accepted. However, I consider knowledge from experience as the more important source because of its negative impacts on real life.

"Nowadays, thanks to the development of technology, computer is now indispensable to life. Some people think that computer is good for children and it should be used daily by children but some others think differently. In my opinion, the latter opinion is true.

First, using computer constantly has bad influence on children's eyes. When they concentrate on computer for too long, their eyes will get tired, which is the main reason for some eyes problems, typically shortsighted.

Moreover, children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills, they will know little about the outside life. It is a well-known fact that people who are addicted to games, especially online games, can eventually bear dangerous consequences. For instance, several teenagers play games without rest, which leads to health depression, a typical example is the death of Korean gamer, who had a non-stop playing for 3 days.

Finally, even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much. Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose, most of them are attracted by facebook, blog, etc. instead. Due to this neglect, they will have a bad result in school because when they can not live without internet, they will have no time for their studying.

In conclusion, although it is undeniable that computer is a crucial part of human life, it still has its bad side, especially for children. People should learn how to use it properly to make it an effective tool because computer should be used not only for entertaining but also for working and studying purpose.",computer has negative effects to children,5.0,275.0,14.0,19.642857142857142,30.0,1.0,10.785714285714286,167.0,0.2363636363636363,0.1454545454545454,0.1054545454545454,0.0581818181818181,0.04,9.0,0.0708661417322834,5.286,0.5127388535031847,273.0,125.92902919994556,0.0,0.0,125.92902919994556,10.4,12.9,11.08,4.0457049439964,0.073,0.174,0.753,39.0,4.0,0.4808917197452229,0,0,1,0.0
"Modern communication technologies such as mobile phones, e-mails and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger have brought significant changes to our lives in recent years. Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether the overall effect of this innovation has been positive or negative. Although there are valid arguments to the contrary, it is my belief that the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication.

To begin with, mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business. With the click of a button, the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds. Furthermore, it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world. With a mobile phone or a laptop, a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop, in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine. Therefore, it seems that these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind.

Nevertheless, opponents of modern communications claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits. They further point out that the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money. Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services. Consequently, people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies.

By way of conclusion, I believe that modern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases; however, the have-nots cannot be ignored simply because they couldn't afford it.",Do modern communication technologies benefit all people,4.0,315.0,13.0,24.23076923076923,35.0,16.0,13.153846153846152,189.0,0.2698412698412698,0.0984126984126984,0.1142857142857142,0.0412698412698412,0.019047619047619,9.0,0.0608108108108108,5.846,0.5406976744186046,315.0,136.81739405100026,0.0,0.0,136.81739405100026,12.7,14.7,12.07,4.4494160088427455,0.137,0.039,0.824,49.0,2.0,0.4970930232558139,2,1,2,0.0
"Nowadays, we can see advertisements everywhere, from television set to posters on the streets. Some people believe that these various advertisements get people to buy products that are unnecessary and only look good on television. I tend to agree with this view.

To boost their sales and win over customers, companies pour a great amount of money into advertising. Most of the time, it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product. By which I mean, huge cooperation hire celebrities as the face of their product. By casting famous singers in their television advertisement, motorcycles or clothes for example, sales increase significantly since youngsters, as the target consumers, love celebrities. Since having these products shows their status, the quality obviously is not relatively important.

However, despite the fact that advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated, it is also true that it plays and important role economically. They introduce new products, and provide various choices, not to mention they are often visually enjoyable, since they aim to grab your attention. Advertising also helps to keep prices at reasonable levels, creates a fair environment for commercial competition. Otherwise the market may be monopolistic, and the price as well as the choice will not be so selective.

"In this world, there is no one who does not know this world 'globalization', which means the world are more closer, and every single countries affects each other more than before in many ways. That is why governmental and non-governmental organizations have been focus on being harmony and contribute to aid to poor countries. It is true that just giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries. In addition, a great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries.

However, I agree that aiding poor countries has positive effects, overweighing its side-effects for the several reasons.

First of all, poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer. To be out of poverty, it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light, electricity, load, highways, natural resources, technology and buildings for companies. Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business. In actual, republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960's. Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties.

Secondly, aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people. If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases, they would never take their abundance for granted. It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love, but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization.

Third, the campaigns might include practical benefits. In globalized world, the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others. When America mortgage loan system went bad, several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated, even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt.

In conclusion, there are abovementioned three key points of positive effects of aid; supporting poor countries to make its economy strong and building humane concepts to people, keeping strong global economy. I strongly believe that being a global neighbor by aiding poor countries would be continues by many organizations and volunteers, and it will make the earth a better place to live.",Giving aid to poorer countries has more negative effects than positive effect,6.0,381.0,18.0,21.166666666666668,34.0,7.0,10.5,228.0,0.2650918635170604,0.1391076115485564,0.1627296587926509,0.0314960629921259,0.0157480314960629,15.0,0.0769230769230769,5.778,0.5234741784037559,376.0,151.92356378902863,0.0,0.0,151.92356378902863,11.6,14.1,12.71,4.280784068602004,0.16,0.124,0.716,49.0,10.0,0.4436619718309859,0,0,1,0.0
"In present day and age, students are normally exposed to extra jobs as early as they start their university. This phenomenon, although in some extents, are proved to have negative effects, I feel strongly that the disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages. In this essay, some of the benefits surrounding this matter will be carefully explained.

It is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs. Part-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities. In addition, that seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities. As a result, students who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience. Moreover, having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation.

Secondly, students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones. By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation, then students' confidence could be significantly gained. Also, working conditions require students the independency in thinking, working, and solving problems, which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities.

Lastly, doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation. Indeed, high studying tuition, added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students. With the money they earn from extra jobs, which normally is not much, those difficulties could be partially solved. Moreover, that helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life.

In conclusion, I feel certain that having a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits . By taking on an extra job, students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience, confidence and accommodation. It is my belief the tendency of getting extra jobs will increase more in the future.",Benefits of students doing extra jobs,5.0,346.0,18.0,19.22222222222222,28.0,11.0,9.5,204.0,0.2745664739884393,0.1589595375722543,0.0982658959537572,0.0346820809248554,0.0231213872832369,10.0,0.0564971751412429,5.944,0.5090439276485789,341.0,138.8799770633138,2.0,-0.1710469338259686,138.7089301294878,12.0,14.2,14.1,4.160971801460949,0.194,0.046,0.76,54.0,6.0,0.4418604651162791,0,0,1,0.0
"Preserving wild animals in zoos is an issue which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate, with supporters maintaining that wild life would be taken good care from professionals, while opponents claim that the animals are deprived of freedom as a result of staying in zoos. From my perspective, animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos.

To begin with, it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings. Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals, it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in. Apparently, the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss. Moreover, if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures. As a result, the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression. It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives.

Nevertheless, supporters would argue that zoos, which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals, would provide better care for the animals inside. They further point out that the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting. However, I would contend that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat. It seems that the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide.

By way of conclusion, it is my belief that wild animals should be set free from zoos not only because they have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression.",zoos should be built to protect rural animals,4.0,310.0,13.0,23.846153846153847,47.0,12.0,12.076923076923077,169.0,0.2516129032258064,0.1483870967741935,0.1225806451612903,0.032258064516129,0.0387096774193548,11.0,0.0718954248366013,6.357,0.4836795252225519,306.0,124.1906757583992,0.0,0.0,124.1906757583992,12.6,14.0,11.49,3.940267192900356,0.144,0.09,0.765,50.0,2.0,0.4658753709198813,0,0,1,0.0
"Today, we no longer fear any contagious diseases, kudos to modern technology and medical advancement. However, it is the contagious behaviors such as addiction and the wrong abuse of drugs that continue to terrorize our society, especially the young ones. It is undeniable that drug addiction is indeed on the rise and effective solutions must be taken in order to trim down the number of drug addicts. Some suggest that it would be better if those caught red-handed using drugs be imprisoned. In my opinion, I disagree to the aforementioned resolution due to the reasons that I will put forward below.

First of all, I do agree that some of the addicts do turn over a new leaf at the prison. Nevertheless, once they return to the society, they tend to relapse and get involved in drugs again. This is because, in the prisons, there would not be any programs or talks that can enlighten and transform them as well as change their perspectives towards drugs. As such, all the efforts of putting them behind bars are simply in vain. Instead, if the addicts are sent to rehabilitation centres, they will treated for their addiction. On top of that, counselors can provide them with counseling and motivation to help them build a new life.

On the other hand, some argue that if the drug addicts are not given intense punishment, they will not change and continue to misuse drugs. Nonetheless, I believe that this is mainly due to the society not accepting the prisoners as a part of them. If only the society or the people surrounding the addicts give them a second chance, I am sure that they will never abuse drugs once more. The support alone is not sufficient. They can also report to the concerned parties about any misuse of drugs at the residential areas. Thus, with more public awareness, drug abuse can be certainly be reduced and eventually brought to a halt without having to put the addicts into jail.

Everyone of us deserves a second chance in life. After all, we are human beings and we learn from our mistakes. Referring to the consequentalist theory, the society should allow leniency for people to experiment and learn, as long as it is on their own expenses. To put it in a nutshell, I believe that sending the drug addicts to rehabilitation centres acts as a beacon of hope for the affected individuals and is also a crucial step in helping them redeem their lives and rejuvenate their lost hopes for a better future rather than sending them to prison.",Those who use drugs should be automatically sentenced to time in prison,4.0,433.0,21.0,20.61904761904762,53.0,6.0,12.238095238095235,236.0,0.2101616628175519,0.1570438799076212,0.0762124711316397,0.0715935334872979,0.0277136258660508,7.0,0.03954802259887,5.571,0.4728033472803347,427.0,189.2250957990262,1.0,-0.0142883379415821,189.2108074610846,10.1,11.0,9.34,4.489194066406447,0.127,0.121,0.752,62.0,7.0,0.5376569037656904,0,0,1,0.0
"My view is that the government should give priorities to invest more money on the basic social welfares such as education and housing instead of subsidizing arts relative programs.

Art is not the key determination of quality of life, but education is. In order to make people better off, it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens. This is simply because knowledge and wisdom is the guarantee of the enhancement of the quality of people's lives for a well-rounded social system.

Admittedly, art, to some extent, serve a valuable function about enriching one's daily lives, for example, it could bring release one's heavy burden of study pressure and refresh human bodies through a hard day from work. However, it is unrealistic to pursuit of this high standard of life in many developing countries, in which the basic housing supply has still been a huge problem with plenty of lower income family have squeezed in a small tight room. By comparison to these issues, the pursuit of art seems unimportant at all.

To conclude, art could play an active role in improving the quality of people's lives, but I think that governments should attach heavier weight to other social issues such as education and housing needs because those are the most essential ways enable to make people a decent life.",Do arts and music improve the quality of life?,4.0,235.0,8.0,29.375,48.0,13.0,15.25,154.0,0.3063829787234042,0.1063829787234042,0.1404255319148936,0.025531914893617,0.0170212765957446,4.0,0.0338983050847457,7.75,0.5752895752895753,235.0,94.97758756336088,1.0,-0.1120446942286036,94.86554286913226,14.8,16.6,11.38,4.121992452326688,0.14,0.072,0.788,29.0,0.0,0.471042471042471,6,3,2,0.0
"In many nations, nowadays, an increasing number of people are deciding to live by themselves/most people prefer.... compared with before. There are some disputes about this trend, however, I believe that it has both positive and negative sides.

There are two major disadvantages related to this issue. The initial drawback is people living by themselves in a house or any kind of accommodation could experience a feeling of isolation. After enduring many stress and challenges in their lives, they do not have anyone to sympathize with, sometimes they may feel scared about something like darkness or ghosts. In some cases, they are more at risk of depression, which is becoming an increasingly severe problem in society, especially the elderly. Another negative thing that can be mentioned is the safety of those who live lonely could be affected by different factors such as sudden illness. Living without others' attention is absolutely disadvantageous since there would be no one can help them out of dangerous situations.

Despite the drawbacks mentioned above, living in one-person households also can be beneficial. Many people become more independent and self-reliant because, without their parents' care, they have to work hard every day to make the cost of living, pay a bill, and manage their budgets. In addition, they can learn how to take care of themselves and other people's lives as well, because independence is a necessary character for youngsters these days. Furthermore, when the younger generation lives alone, they may have more personal time to do whatever they desire. For instance, they get permission to hang out with friends or joining in some clubs in school, and embellish their homes with their preferred decorations.

"Some today argue that living in metropolises is not good for the health of people there. In my opinion, though this claim may be true in some situations, it is not in others.

On the one hand, there are several issues that impact people's health negatively. For instance, a person who lives in big cities has to deal with the dangers such as air pollution, contaminated water, stress at work, etc. If there were fewer people and more open spaces like parks, lakes, etc, the air would be cleaner and the stress of people would be reduced. Many people live in these metropolises neen to ger back to the nature after living there for a period of time.

On the other hand, many hospitals with high standard have opened to improve the people's health. For example, there are many hospitals with experts that focused on general problems that people have to cope with such as the stress, the pressure of urban liife. Naturally, thee quality of those is better than the government's hospitals in the countryside, although the prices are much higher. Moreover, there are many places like gymnasiums, yoga clubs where you can relax and downshift to a less stressful life that you can't find in the suburbs.

In conclusion, though there are many problems negatively affecting human health that peole have to cope with when living in urban areas, there are many ways to improve the situations of city dwellers' physical and mental health.

"There is an upward trend that individuals believe that the news is unrealistic. Accordingly, reading the newspaper and watching news programs are unnecessary. In my opinion, I moderately disagree with this statement according to a number of reasons which I will mention in this essay.

To start with, more citizens are likely to neglect crucial news since tabloids are rampant in the market. Indeed, it can be seen obviously that digital news is created to attract readers' attention. A myriad of online news is written with attractive titles, and some are fake. Moreover, individuals have never undergone the same situation which they have approached on the news; therefore, they tend to believe that taking time to follow the news is wasteful. Undoubtedly, it is a dangerous tendency since people can easily be lured into social scammers.

On the contrary, I argue that keeping up with the latest news both digital and paper forms is inevitable for each individual. Without a doubt, news which is broadcasted on television or newspaper is a means of media for numerous people to keep up to date with domestic and international events. Subsequently, watching television programs will provide viewers with useful knowledge to avoid fraud and other forms of breaking laws. For instance, a widely popular online news site named ""The New York Times"", which does not also bring readers to events on a global scale but also consists of helpful social knowledge.

To sum up, many consider that they will not be capable of connecting with the news both online and on paper. In consequence, spending time watching the news or reading it on paper is a waste of time. In this essay, I argued why I disagree with this statement due to the necessity of understanding social events and preventing being tricked.",Do you agree or disagree that following news is a waste of time?,4.0,299.0,15.0,19.933333333333334,32.0,10.0,10.133333333333333,173.0,0.2341137123745819,0.1505016722408027,0.1036789297658862,0.040133779264214,0.0167224080267558,12.0,0.0816326530612244,6.067,0.5089820359281437,295.0,120.26774021337344,0.0,0.0,120.26774021337344,11.1,12.1,11.08,4.164024894446995,0.055,0.096,0.849,43.0,0.0,0.4550898203592814,0,0,1,0.0
"There is growing evidence that man-made activities are making global temperatures higher. What might be the man-made causes of temperatures rising? How should we deal with this problem?

It is undoubtedly true that human - made actions are raising the global temperatures. This essay will look at several principal reasons and suggest some possible solutions to mitigate the problem.

There are some primary factors that contribute to the climate change. Firstly, deforestration is non-stop growing with little prevention from authorities, which mitigate the function of natual conditioning system - forest. Once this system is harmfully effected, there comes an unbalance in the air humans breathe. Secondly, factories and plants now are burning a huge amount of fossil fuel. Using these resources creates carbon dioxide and toxic heat into the asmostphere, resulting in a negative global transform .

Actions can be taken to solve the problem mentioned above. Most importantly, governments should restrict the number of tree cut down by imposing heavy pubnishments on those who break the rule. This could help nourish our forest so that it can fullfill its holly role. Another solution is that in stead of fossil fuel, people should use renewable sources to cut down the amount of exhaust in the air. Those sources could be wind, sunshine, water, etc.

In conclution, there are a number of factors leading to climate change and measures can be taken to tackle this issue.",There is growing evidence that man-made activities are making global temperatures high,5.0,235.0,16.0,14.6875,24.0,7.0,7.0,161.0,0.2936170212765957,0.2,0.076595744680851,0.0382978723404255,0.0425531914893617,3.0,0.024390243902439,5.188,0.5977011494252874,218.0,86.67743695152942,6.0,-0.4702162282152593,86.20722072331417,8.9,10.9,12.23,4.338004047051896,0.107,0.104,0.789,16.0,8.0,0.4291187739463601,0,0,1,0.0
"Economic progress is often used to measure a country's success. However, some people believe that other factors are more important. What other factors should also be considered when measuring a country's success? Do you think one factor is more important than others?

There are many factors to assess a country such as economic, health, technology, and human rights. The success of a country could be seen in several aspects but in my opinion, the education system should be seen as the most essential factor instead of the economic progress

The development of education, health, human rights, and technology should be considered as measures of a country's prosperity. Healthcare services and medical staff play a core role in improving people's quality of life and prolonging life expectancy. The development of technology makes it easy to approach the world and catch up with important information. A country cannot be flourished if the human rights are not guaranteed, oppression and exploitation, and gender inequality often only occur in underdeveloped and backward countries. Finally, the education system is the core that creates and improves the quality of the factors mentioned above. Without education, there would be no high-quality healthcare services, no modern technological equipment, and a very low sense of human rights.

The foundation of all countries' success is the education system. If the economy is very inflationary and difficult to curb inflation, the education system has made steady progress with scientific reforms. The education system is a place to train talents and new generations that directly contributes to the overall development of an entire nation, the more outstanding people there are, the more they will improve the quality of both the white collars and the black collars in the future. For the record, education is a direct influence on the health system, technology, and human rights, and at the same time the economy. An economist or businessman without inheriting a good education system is very difficult to bring off profit and easy to go out of business.

In conclusion, there is an extensive diversity to assess nations, but I believe that education is the best accurate measure of its success.",EDUCATION AND ECONOMIC,5.0,357.0,17.0,21.0,49.0,10.0,11.0,197.0,0.3025210084033613,0.1092436974789916,0.1204481792717086,0.0252100840336134,0.0196078431372549,10.0,0.0568181818181818,5.778,0.4590570719602977,358.0,151.84644399517146,0.0,0.0,151.84644399517146,12.7,13.9,12.59,3.98574204285048,0.187,0.046,0.767,43.0,0.0,0.4640198511166253,0,0,1,0.0
"Smoking has been banned in public places like parks, museums, and hospitals in many nations and the law is supported by a lot of people. I agree with this initiative since it reduces the harmful effects on the surrounding people and it also discourages smokers from smoking.

The main reason why making it illegal for smoking in public places makes sense is that it minimizes the risk of innocent people being unintentionally affected by a smoker nearby, which is called passive smoke. Passive smoking leads to enormous consequences, especially for children and pregnant women because it leads to diseases like cancer among youngsters and babies. A ban in public places is required to limit this type of exposure. For example, after Ireland introduced a law to ban smoking in all indoor places like restaurants and pubs, there was a significant decline in the number of employees suffering from lung cancer and other lethal diseases.

Another reason why it's wise to bring about this ban is that it encourages more and more smokers to quit their habit. Since it's not allowed to smoke in public areas, people who want to have a cigarette need to go outside and it appears to be a great annoyance and impolite if they're having dinner with their customers or friends. Therefore, smokers consume fewer cigarettes and gradually abandon their habit. One piece of evidence is that in a street interview in Germany, nearly 60% of ex-smokers gave up smoking due to social pressure brought about by smoking bans.

In conclusion, I believe that smoking in public places should be made against the law so that it prevents innocent people from developing serious health conditions caused by passive smoking and reduces the number of smokers.",Smoking in public places - the ban is justified,4.0,289.0,11.0,26.27272727272728,39.0,10.0,12.909090909090908,175.0,0.28719723183391,0.1314878892733564,0.0968858131487889,0.0519031141868512,0.0034602076124567,8.0,0.0529801324503311,6.333,0.554140127388535,289.0,112.85306832752195,0.0,0.0,112.85306832752195,12.4,15.2,11.38,4.189626959685367,0.129,0.141,0.73,49.0,2.0,0.4522292993630573,0,0,1,0.0
"Some proponents of exams argue that formal tests show more efficacy when it comes to assessing scholars' aptitude instead of regular observation or projects. From my perspective, I am opposed to this opinion for some following reasons.

The benefits of regular assessment are plentiful. Engaging students' in projects facilitates them in developing different skills which can reinforce their future career. Supposing that soft skills are nowadays highly entailed by many companies, schools should place more premium on creating opportunities for undergraduates to brush up on skills such as team-working skills, problem-solving and social skills. Those who brim with various skill assets and proficiency are certainly beneficiaries when it comes to the rigorous recruitment competition. Besides, from teachers' perspective, they are provided a comprehensive evaluation on their pupils owing to this method, thereby scheming appropriate learning strategies to employ each students' ability effectively.

Furthermore, regular assessments render transparency compared to formal examination. Tests only offer transient results at the moment the examinees proceed. The results are strenuously guaranteed whether their competence lives up to the grades. Additionally, the act of falsifying test scores is prone to jeopardise the clarity of exams as well as motivation of learners. There is a likelihood that other students regard the case of cheaters as prime examples to imitate, getting distracted from pursuing knowledge for themselves. Whereas projects criticise learners based on their aptitude to emerge the thing they learn with reality, forging the strong bond between theoretical knowledge and practical activities.

In conclusion, I concede that exams play a pivotal role in judging performance of students; however, they should be combined with continuous assessment to acknowledge their genuine adeptness.",ASSESSMENT TO ABILITY OF STUDENTS,4.0,274.0,14.0,19.571428571428573,34.0,7.0,8.571428571428571,194.0,0.2956204379562044,0.1751824817518248,0.1058394160583941,0.0401459854014598,0.010948905109489,5.0,0.032051282051282,6.643,0.6295081967213115,270.0,93.02811216324154,2.0,-0.0557725146390612,92.9723396486025,13.3,16.5,16.65,4.571486572109171,0.124,0.043,0.833,36.0,2.0,0.3934426229508196,0,0,1,0.0
"Due to the development of technology in recent decades, various features of life we have been taking for granted are now under serious overhaul to adapt to the growing wave of technology and electronics. From the transportation of classrooms to the virtual realm, the development of many communication technologies from letter and radio waves to emails and chatting applications, and similarly, the rising dominance of e-books and the assumed decline of its predecessor, old plain paper books, as more and more people participate in this growing wave. Many people believe this can have many positive impacts on the reading community, while others think the negativity of this trend is irrefutable. Personally speaking, while I agree with the latter statement, the advantages of e-books should not be overlooked.

First and foremost, it is undeniably true that the compelling nature of e-books is indisputable, as demonstrated by their growing popularity due to the apparent convenience they allow. E-reading permits the readers to access the contents of the book at any moment they prefer because of the development of the gadgets they are stored in, improving their accessible nature. In addition to that, the cost of e-books is often cheaper than their physical counterparts, on account of the need for production, premises, maintenance, packaging and delivery, employees, and on and forth, all of which become oblivious to the virtual realm. The benefit is undoubtedly substantial for both parties involved as the price goes down, further aiding the reading community.

Nonetheless, one critical disadvantage of electronic books is the lack of physical experience displayed in the traditional variant. The tactile feeling and the smell of paper and ink from a new, fresh copy are a prominent part of the turning pages experience for many people, encouraging them to continue their walkthrough through the book, an effect online copy cannot provide. Additionally, continuous exposure to technological devices can have detrimental effects on the health of the users. Research has shown the signal waves and lights electronics emit can damage the eyes or negatively affect the neurological functions of the brain, as exhibited in a study in Ireland, as the researchers observed the connection between children with eye problems and their usage of tablets to read e-books.

In conclusion, even though the advantages delivered to e-readers cannot be refuted, the possible consequences and the insufficiency of technological copies in their abilities to satisfy consumers overshadowed them. Although the momentum of e-books is unlikely to halt, it is improbable for e-books to replace their traditional equivalents.","In recent years, more and more people are choosing to read e-books rather than paper books.DO THE ADVANTAGES OUTWEIGH THE DISADVANTAGES OF THIS TREND?",4.0,419.0,14.0,29.928571428571427,53.0,16.0,15.428571428571429,254.0,0.3293556085918854,0.116945107398568,0.1026252983293556,0.0214797136038186,0.0143198090692124,9.0,0.0420560747663551,7.067,0.5214592274678111,426.0,159.78223640586015,0.0,0.0,159.78223640586015,16.1,19.3,14.28,4.908410456506993,0.121,0.039,0.839,54.0,0.0,0.463519313304721,2,1,2,0.0
"The diversity of students in talents, specialities or social atmospheres has led to the belief that a general categorization of students' abilities is necessary to promote their growth. While there are good reasons behind this argument, others believe the lack of such combinations will be unbeneficial to a child's mental development. In my opinion, however, while I agree with the latter statement, I also believe that there are possible risks in a socially diverse environment that might be unbeneficial to the parties involved for the following reasons.

First and foremost, on the one hand, school is often the place where students are prepared and equipped with many desirable skills to qualify for life. Therefore, it is advantageous for educational institutions to host classes with diverse cultural profiles to create the circumstances for children to interact and befriend others from a wide range of cultures and capabilities, helping them to strengthen their proficiency in many essential skills, for instance, communication and adaption. Additionally, students from such mixed settings will benefit considerably from the cooperation from each other, as they assist each other with their strengths and weaknesses, working together to refine themselves and achieve their goals. In short, a diverse community will develop an individual with well-rounded capacities.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, the diversity of individuals' experiences and masteries might result in an inadequateness for a focused environment for a particular subject since it is improbable to have a group of shared enthusiasm from random origins. This could be undesirable for students with ambition for a high level of understanding of a curriculum, as they might want to find companions with similar interests to practice with. Moreover, it would be more practical for students to delve into subjects they are familiar with rather than forcing them to mindlessly trying at a course they are unsuitable in, in order to make use of their talents. To clarify these points, the German education system allows the divergent of the system to effectively utilize each and every participant's talents after providing the basic foundation. This provides the students with the best of both worlds, as they can both have the broad and immersive knowledge necessary to aid them in their lives.

In conclusion, the importance of a diverse education environment is unquestionable in order to improve the aspect of social skills for learners. However, a concentrated education is also crucial to students' welfare. As such, it is advisable to according to a student's mastership and desires before placing him in an appropriate circumstance.",It is important to ensure that children with a wide range of abilities and from a variety of social backgrounds mix with each other at school.

"Healthy lifestyles are becoming widely popular with the general generation. Although experts in the healthcare domain advise that the elders should take part in physical activities on a regular basis, a great number of them ignore it. In this essay, I will argue why health and safety problems are the main factors which affect the way older people get exercise. Besides, I will provide several solutions to solve these problems.

When it comes to the elderly, there are health issues to be considered as older people are more likely to get diseases. Indeed, ailments such as diabetes or high blood pressure affect their motor abilities. Therefore, seniors are unable to do physical activities according to weak physical conditions. An obvious example is my friend's grandmother, who is at the age of 69, is suffering from arteriosclerosis. Her grandmother is unable to walk or do basic hygiene without supporters. Furthermore, safety problems are factors which should be noticed. In recent years, sports centres have grown excessively. However, these fitness centres only provide facilities which are also known as gym equipment for young people. Accordingly, weak eye sights and joints can lead to severe injuries in older citizens if they approach inappropriate fitness facilities.

In order to tackle these problems, developing a positive attitude to exercise at an early age would be a necessary solution. In short, by providing basic healthcare education for younger generations, they can build up an exercise routine which can stick to them from an early age. As a result, young people will be able to prevent the ageing process and chronic diseases. Moreover, the government should give the elders opportunities to enhance their strength by creating more walking pathways in safe areas. Even more, encouraging older citizens to do internal nourishing exercise is a great method since it can facilitate a healthy development both mentally and physically for the elderly.

To sum up, even though it is recommended to work out regularly, many older people remaining lack exercise.

"There have been polarised notions regarding whether teachers should educate students to strive for ethical virtues such as differentiating good and wrong in addition to basic theoretical knowledge. Others uphold the opposite perception that teachers' only duty is imparting academic education for learners. Personally, I strongly believe that teachers should combine both ways to...

On the one hand, it is evident that the majority of teachers are paid with inadequate remuneration regardless of their great devotion to their career. This is also the contributory factor to why teachers avoid intervening in their students' personal problems apart from schoolwork. Furthermore, some people believe that moulding children's personality ought to be parents' responsibility instead of bystanders as teachers. For the reason that each individual varies, their personality traits have the likelihood to be overwhelmingly different to others. Educating properly for more than 30 separately-mental characteristics in one classroom definitely causes hurdles for teachers.

On the other hand, since students' mainly contribute their day-to-day time to school, which has been proven accounting to more than 6 hours, there is a little room for doubt that they have the utmost opportunity to be exposed to teachers. Likewise, teachers are presented with chances to embrace each student to shape individual behaviour patterns. Provided that students' acquire a competence of rules and absorb ethical principles, they can avoid being entangled with miscarriage of injustice, instead become a law-abiding citizen. It is indisputable that children's future is critically attributed to the proper personality training in their formative years. Therefore, forming precious manners in their early years could facilitate them to an impressive extent in manifold fields, for example, in work force and relationships as well.

"Communication has played a critical role in the development of our civilization. As such, the development of this domain in recent decades is highly praised due to the enablement of real-time, worldwide interaction such development provided. However, they do not come without detriments, and the following essay will discuss both the advantages and disadvantages of online communication.

First and foremost, it is undeniable that modern communication technologies have allowed many groundbreaking breakthroughs in recent years. This is because, as mentioned in the task, it has enabled transborder cooperation between various individuals on a global scale through virtual verbal communication. Communication in a community plays a vital role in the advancement of that community by permitting productive usage of every member's abilities, and the enlargement of the scale of transmission to an international level has, in turn, enlarged our community to a global society, authorizing effective utilization of every human beings' talents. Additionally, assistance is also facilitated thanks to communication. The extended reach of communication means we can reach out to each other to find collaboration in order to assist each other, by filling in each other's strengths and weaknesses, and talented, ambitious individuals can set out for aids and opportunities to improve themselves or open their gateways to success. For instance, many residents in my home country often utilize online interaction as a way to practice languages with native speakers and find people with similar interests or to find scholarships and sponsorships by attending interviews with people halfway around the globe.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, online communication also has its fair share of dilemmas. To clarify this point, a characteristic nature of online communication is anonymity. Anonymous communication is the prevalent form of interaction on the internet, which created a perfect habitat for a myriad of people with malicious intentions, also known as scammers. Due to the challenging task of identifying online, people often cannot distinguish the discretion of their subjects, risking the exploitation of their gullibility. Because of the same reason, social civility also experienced a downward trend online, as people wreak havoc and act vulgarly without worries of consequences.

"There is often much debate around the fact that scientific discoveries should be conducted by private corporations rather than the government. While this trend may bring about some benefits, I would argue that they are eclipsed by the drawbacks.

There are numerous advantages to letting scientific research be controlled by private companies. First and foremost, it is recommended that such companies tend to meet society's expectations faster than the government. This can be explained by the fact that investing money to conduct research is likely to enhance productivity and result, hence, introducing to the masses a number of desirable products. Secondly, non-governmental companies should be in charge of carrying out scientific research in order to consolidate their reputation and position in the international arena. This helps them attract more human resources and reap profits.

On the other hand, there are some good reasons why the authorities should take responsibility for scientific research. Firstly, it is advisable that the government is able to ensure safety and many unexpected outcomes that might occur. To be more specific they can rely on the capital flows to equip high-end facilities and support a group of scientists in terms of checking the quality and potential consequences. As a result, it would become more reliable and ethical to the consumers and their business partners. Additionally, while some independent companies seek for profits, such research conducted by local authorities might be accessible to all social classes. For instance, most citizens are able to prepare a Kit test themselves due to the convenience and the availability.

In conclusion, while there are some benefits for private companies to carry out scientific research such as rapidly responding to people's demands and enhancing the reputation in the market, I am of the opinion that the government is much better in this field regarding minimizing the risks of these studies and the accessibility.",should scientific research be conducted by private companies or the govt,4.0,311.0,14.0,22.214285714285715,53.0,10.0,12.071428571428571,182.0,0.247588424437299,0.1479099678456591,0.1254019292604501,0.0418006430868167,0.0321543408360128,6.0,0.0410958904109589,7.143,0.5294117647058824,311.0,132.79707865662695,0.0,0.0,132.79707865662695,13.1,15.3,13.69,4.511062121041712,0.133,0.013,0.853,38.0,0.0,0.4970588235294118,0,0,1,0.0
"It is argued that governments should introduce a limit on maximum wage; Others, however, believe that it should be free for employees to earn as much as companies possibly offer them. I personally agree with the first viewpoint.

On the one hand, it may seem reasonable to allow people to get extraordinarily high pay packages as long as companies are willing to pay. The talented and high-skilled executives will be attracted to work for these enterprises. That would have beneficial effects on productivity and creativity which may bring significant revenues for the company. As a result, a country with a huge amount of successful businesses seems to easily build up a thriving economy in which the citizens are provided with a high living standard.

In spite of these above arguments, I agree that governments should adopt a maximum wage legislation. The income inequality causes the huge pay gap between the highest and lowest earners and by introducing a maximum wage, it can help to reduce this difference. This positive change can make employees feel more motivated to work harder because of the fair payment. Furthermore, instead of spending a huge sum on executives' salaries, companies can use that money to invest in other crucial aspects, such as marketing or researching and developing products which may make significant contributions to companies' profit.

In conclusion, I believe that it would do wonders for the development of a nation if the government sets a limit on the employee remuneration.",Governments should not allow salaries above a certain level,4.0,246.0,11.0,22.363636363636363,37.0,7.0,11.545454545454543,158.0,0.2479674796747967,0.1829268292682926,0.1178861788617886,0.0365853658536585,0.048780487804878,4.0,0.0333333333333333,6.182,0.5814814814814815,243.0,104.26167978525623,0.0,0.0,104.26167978525623,13.2,14.0,12.31,4.2816943472127535,0.21,0.056,0.734,34.0,0.0,0.4703703703703704,0,0,1,0.0
"Although schools are generally supposed to be safe and harmonious places, recent years have witnessed an upward trend in school violence across the world. This phenomenon is attributed to several causes, which can be tackled by a collective effort from both parents and educators.

To begin with, there are numerous explanations for violent acts among schoolchildren. One of them may come down to their psychological deficiencies when brought up in dysfunctional families. Drug and alcohol abuse, domestic violence, among other factors, are believed to cause worry, hatred and resentment in small children, influencing them to act aggressively when interacting with classmates or teachers at school. Besides, social media is also to blame for this worrying trend among teenagers. At this early age, many have yet to develop a sense of right and wrong, which means overexposure to brutal content on online platforms would desensitize them to violence in the real world. For example, watching too many videos featuring gory fighting scenes on Youtube could easily make a child believe those acts to be normal occurrences, justifying some students not hesitant to resort to violence to settle disagreement.

To curb this violence, parents and institutions can take several action. Firstly, it should be ensured that no social evils and disaccord exist within the households. If children are nurtured in a healthy environment, it is less likely that they will adopt violence as ways to resolve conflict. Besides, parents should monitor what their children view on social media so as to minimize the latter's exposure to harmful contents that fuel violent behaviors. Moreover, it is of importance that school leaders administer strict punishment on students displaying such acts. This would serve as a deterrent to repeat violators as well as would-be ones.

To conclude, violence taking place in a school setting can stem from several reasons, including dysfunctional family dynamics and media consumption, which call for immediate action from the guardians as well as schools themselves.",SCHOOL VIOLENCE,4.0,324.0,15.0,21.6,36.0,11.0,10.8,214.0,0.2777777777777778,0.1666666666666666,0.1141975308641975,0.0308641975308641,0.0339506172839506,7.0,0.0426829268292682,6.0,0.5844875346260388,319.0,125.23774174488425,1.0,-0.0038325787175324,125.23390916616673,11.7,14.9,13.52,4.528800955055145,0.073,0.214,0.713,47.0,4.0,0.4487534626038781,0,0,1,0.0
"Nowadays, there is an increasing number of people staying at home, working and studying online via modern technology thanks to its affordability and accessibility. This essay believes that this is a detrimental change because spending too much time on technological devices could leads to physical health problems and this trend might result in the issue of social isolation.

The first reason for my disapproval of home working and schooling is that this could pose a serious threat to the public well-being. In order to keep up with the latest work, people have to spend hours looking at the screen and sitting at a certain place to take part in video conferences and online classes, write reports and emails,... As a result, people might suffer from a number of health issues such as eye strain, obesity, and poor posture, which results in poor performance at work and study, and especially put a strain on the financial budget. According to the Time to Focus report, in the UK, 25.2 billion was allocated to treat eye problems in 2020, when the citizens had to work and study online as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Moreover, online working and studying is the culprit of isolation from society. Staying at home alone for a long time prevents people from having face-to-face interaction, which makes people become familiar with loneliness, avoid meeting others, and gradually feel difficult to integrate into the community. As a consequence, they are more likely to struggle with mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. For example, the WHO reported that the COVID-19 pandemic triggers a 25% increase in the prevalence of anxiety and depression worldwide because of the lack of real-life interaction.

In conclusion, the development of technology allows more and more people around the world to work and study at home. I believe that this is a negative trend because this would harm the public well-being and increase the number of people isolated from the community.","many adults are working from home, and more children are beginning to study from home because technology has become cheaper and more accessible.

"There are widely divergent schools of thought on the issue of whether a number of individuals allocate their budget to become participants in cultural and athletic events or not. From my personal perspective, I firmly assert that these events are beneficial for participants.

Initially, one of the most noticeable reasons is that people could expand their horizons of knowledge via making a payment for partaking in sports and cultural events. This is on account of the extensive understanding about their civilizations, traditions, and customs that can provide citizens and visitors with a deeper insight into national gastronomy and cultural diversity. That can boost national identity and increase mutual understanding among indigenous people and foreigners. For instance, Hue festivals, which attract a plethora of travelers nationwide and worldwide, are celebrated by the government to introduce the image of Vietnam to international friends, which can help visitors gain a variety of knowledge about Vietnamese civilization.

In addition, engaging in athletic and cultural events is a means of entertainment that has a tendency to make the resident feel a sense of relaxation and excitement. To clarify, spectators' stress could be radically released by shouting out to support their teams or athletes, hence, the sportsmanship of supporters is more likely to be fostered. Simultaneously, the energetic atmosphere of these events would increase spectators' exhilaration, which could improve their work performance and foster their productivity considerably.

All in all, I personally advocate the idea that the allocation to engage in events about culture and athletics has a beneficial influence. This is because participants could have a wider range of understanding about their traditions and foster their quality of work more effectively.",Some people spend a lot of money attending cultural or sports events.

"In today's modern world, it is believed that the adolescent has more tendency to create online network rather than making real-life relationships. This occurs due to the convenience that the internet has provided and in order to prevent its consequence, the young should be encouraged to foster their network in reality.

There are two main causes that explain the tendency of making friends via virtual life of the juvenile. First and foremost, social networking sites provide users with a vast amount of convenient functions which connect people regardless of time and location. To be more specific, teenagers are now not only can easily add a new friend into their list of friends, widen their connection to other people but also freely express their opinion in a convenient and time-saving way. For example, Facebook contains millions of groups with similarity in hobbies, passions and purposes, in which the young can access to their desired community within one click. Besides, the breakout of Covid-19 has influenced the way people, especially the teenager's communication way as they have to spend hours doing everything such as studying or playing games online, which weakens their ability to create face-to-face conversations.

Several solutions should be taken up in order to tackle the issue as spending a large amount of time on virtual relationships can not only cause anxiety and depression but also disconnect to reality. It is advisable that parents and teachers encourage their children to create healthy bonds with real-life peers by forming study groups or sport teams. Besides, time limitation for using technological devices should be set off in order to manage the juvenile's online duration. For instance, they are able to use their phone 30 minutes after supper and are not allowed to use them one hour before going to bed.

"Shopping centers have been increasing in popularity over the last decades because of their huge advantages. Whether people go there for shopping or entertainment purposes, they provide all kinds of services. In years to come, I strongly believe that people go to shopping malls for both shopping and recreation reasons.

On the one hand, a shopping plaza is an ideal shopping place. It has numerous stores that sell a wide range of products, such as clothes and jewelleries, from both local and international brands. For example, it is straightforward for people to purchase high-end sports footwear from the Nike brand in the center. They can try wearing shoes and get advice from the shop assistants before deciding a shoes model they want.

On the other hand, a shopping mall is a complex building with many entertainment facilities, in particular, restaurants, caf shops and cinemas. Evidently, people can choose it as a place to socialize with their family and friends. For instance, there are many restaurants which serve a wide range of traditional cuisines from many countries all around the world in the shopping mall. People can have a cozy gathering there to taste specialities.

In conclusion, I suppose that the causes people go to the shopping malls depend on their intentions. It suggests that the shopping malls upgrade their facilities frequently to serve the customers' needs.","In the future, the main reason for going to the shopping mall will be for entertainment, not to shop.

"In the modern era, online news channels gradually supersede conventional channels ranging from newspapers or TV news programs and people tend to opt for this means to read national and international news. In my opinion, this trend is positive and has a significant benefit for the public for some reasons that I will elaborately explain in this essay.

News on the Internet helps to cut down on a considerable amount of resources such as human resources and papers... Unlike TV programs, online news does needn't hosts to monitor programs which allows manufacturers to allocate money for other activities. Moreover, the internet allows people to access information without taking newspapers. As a result, we can abstain the logging and deforestation to produce paper. For example, there are many channels on social media platforms such as Facebook, Tiktok or Instagram that you can access to read the news.

In addition, people can access information broadly, flexibly, and quickly when they read news on the Internet. The individuals are able to update information in both domestic and abroad news or find the previous posts whenever just one click. A pertinent example of this is that, in the past, when people want to know news during the day, they have to wait for news programs at 7 o'clock, which is inconvenient. Besides that, online news updates information more quickly than newspapers because they need time to compile, format and print. That is the reason why what you read in newspapers today is the news of yesterday.

In conclusion, the news on the Internet helps reduce resources dramatically and also allows people to access information conveniently, and quickly. However, it is essential for journalists to verify the accuracy of the information to provide the public with reliable news in the future.","Many people no longer read newspapers or watch TV news programmes.

"Trying ro do those things which are widely considered dangerous seems uncommon among the majority. People always have a fear of unknown things and its consequences. To my mind, regaraless of all following consequences, taking risks gives more benifirs than potential dangers.

On the one hand , people seem to have a fear of the unknown things, which is an explainable feeling, taking risks means people have to exchange what they are possessing such as their proverty, their house or even their lives; Therefore not many people want to gamble for an uncertain reward. For example, an entrepreneur of a lucrative company takes risks investing in a smaller firm, but later this firm bankrupts and leads to his company on the brink of collapse. People will be more inclined into maintaining their achievement than change it.

On the other hand, it is apparent that unforeseen opportunities often come from risk-takings. Endeavouring to do new things is not only give you more experiences but also broaden your horizon. Although you could lose when taking risks, yet the lesson you receive from it is more treasurable. For instance, a risky traveller seems always posing a threat to his life; however, he has gained a comprehensive understanding about the word by his own experience. Taking risks will give people a wonderful insight that they may not be aware of before.

"In many parts of the world people do research in family history. Some people believe research on the previous generation to be useful while others say that it is better to focus on the present and future generation.discuss both views and show your opinion.

People are facing a dilemma whether one should do research about their family tree or pay attention to the present and future generation. Recently, this phenomenon has been brought to public attention with people standing on two different sides and this essay will demonstrate my point of view.

On the one hand, it is argued that people should place an emphasis on focusing on the present and future generation mainly because they think that people can not learn anything from the past because they are obsolete. To elucidate, advocates have pointed out that since the world is innovating everyday, everything that happened in the past might have no influence on today's world. Therefore, many think that it would be better for people to focus on the present and future generation. Furthermore, advocates of this view also accentuate that the time one uses to comprehend and learn about the family tree can be utilized for addressing other issues such as how to deal with plagues that are labeled as incurable or how to tackle proliferation of joblessness, famine or global warming.

On the other hand, though the aforementioned statements seem compelling, some deem that they are inadequate for two chief reasons. Firstly, if individuals study their family history, they will have the opportunity to enrich and hone practical skills from their ancestors. To exemplify, this is because the bulk of the predecessors have engaged in a myriad of wars which involved a profusion of skills like interprofessional collaboration and how to overcome difficulties . Hence, the younger generation can learn from the previous one on how to cope with privations and how to collaborate with each other. Learning about the previous generation can foster emotional connection. Investigating about the past, discovering hardships and challenges that they have gone through can instill the later generation with a sense of gratitude and appreciation for the endeavors and contributions of the ancestor.

In conclusion, although focusing on the young and future generation can be conducive to the society because it will help people to have a clearer and more insightful view about what individuals are facing, I deem that people can be ameliorated from learning from the past since it will help the younger generation to comprehend what the forerunners have done and to facilitate them to be better.",learn about family history or focus on present and future generation,5.0,429.0,15.0,28.6,67.0,9.0,16.2,212.0,0.2191142191142191,0.1678321678321678,0.0979020979020979,0.0396270396270396,0.0349650349650349,9.0,0.0483870967741935,7.125,0.4478260869565217,417.0,182.54241628138533,3.0,-0.1988964616097537,182.3435198197756,13.7,16.2,12.48,4.361949205436871,0.097,0.04,0.863,73.0,4.0,0.5282608695652173,11,4,4,0.0
"Nowadays whether or not learning mathematics in school become a hot debate topic among parents. Some parents think that the subject ""Mathematics"" is irrelevant to be learned in school. However, other parents opine that it should be a mandatory subject. Both sides of arguments will be further discussed in this essay.

One point of view is that parents believe that mathematics is no longer important and it should be removed as a school subject. They think that it is no longer needed because computer take over tasks which required mathematics skill and it can run the operation very fast in its system. For example,there are computer program like Microsoft Excel can solve complex mathematics equation in few seconds. This is the reason why parents believe that their children should not learn mathematics in school.

In opposite point of view, there are also some parents think that their children should learn mathematics as a learning basic in school althought it might not be used in future. The reason is that, mathematics can help children to think faster because their brain will be always active and also more alert to surrounding. For example, children can realise directly if the change gotten is in wrong amount when they buy something in a shop. They can perform the mathematical calculation directly in their brain without relying on gadgets.

"Historically, education is one of the most important issues that people concerned about. Whether children should learn curriculum about science, however, aroused heated debate recently. In my view, it is obvious that science should be included in common education.

First, we have no reason to drop the science course from all the school which include amount of students who love learning science. It is because that science, I think, is an essential part of fundamental education as well as arts. We should provide opportunities to the students who want to become an engineer, biologist or somebody else rather than only teaching arts in schools. It means that what we really need is an all-rounded education model, meanwhile, we should pay more attention to the personality development.

Moreover, learning science can benefit to the intelligence and logical thinking, which are highly valued in modern society. An interviewee, for instance, would be more competitive than other candidates if he or she harbors a wide range of highly specialized knowledge. We cannot deny that in today's workforce market, students of science and technology are more popular than who graduates from arts, and this is already the mainstream in a wide range of countries.

Although so many benefits I mentioned above, that is not to say that general education should only pay attention to developing science technology teaching. There are, of course, students passionate in arts for its own sake, and we have no reason to force them to learn science and vise versa.

In sum, the most important aim of general education, I think, is to cultivate children's all-rounded abilities and personal traits, which is we should indeed focus on rather than the composition of curriculum.",Should children learn science in school?,5.0,283.0,13.0,21.76923076923077,33.0,12.0,12.538461538461538,171.0,0.254416961130742,0.1413427561837456,0.0848056537102473,0.07773851590106,0.0318021201413427,9.0,0.072,6.143,0.4984520123839009,281.0,126.28069277056586,2.0,-0.0509030010107346,126.22978976955513,11.8,13.9,12.07,4.08873862954568,0.128,0.03,0.842,39.0,1.0,0.5046439628482973,2,1,2,0.0
"A foreign language plays an enormously important role in children's development. Obviously, this concern is proliferating and gaining fame among pupils. However, the impact of this trend has become under scrutiny and has been concern for many people. Although learning foreign linguistics for children is unacceptable since it will give negative impact on their development, others said that it is brilliant idea for children to broaden much more horizon regarding global culture through other languages.

Needless to say, children may not realize that this activity has a negative repercussion for them when they study varied language background at elementary school. This is because they may get confused regarding this sphere, and this impacts their development. William James Marco Pollo, an educational consultant, believed that this activity has its significant drawback for bilingual children when it comes to learn other languages at early stage. This result was children who took foreign language had a lack of fluency to communication, thus, they would talk more slowly in comparison with pupils who just understand their mother language. All in all, it is argued that focusing on learning second language at primary school will give drawback in terms of child development.

As a matter of fact, there is counter-argument against prior statement. Learning second language is pivotal activity that should be taken for pupils into consideration. Due to this activity, children are prepared for obtaining plenty of knowledge in the case of world heritage sites. A 2015 Hiroshima University study supported this. The experts conducted research with a random sample drawn from 200 Japanese secondary-school students that learned English language since at primary school. Astonishingly, 67% of students who learnt bilingual language had considerably more knowledgeable regarding international culture through language than children who just learn native language. Hence, what delights in this activity is learning foreign language since the first stage is necessary for the pupils.

In conclusion, albeit studying foreign language will ruin their development, the merits of this activity are more than the negative. Where possibly, learning foreign language should be considered to become mandatory sphere at primary school.",IS IT ACCEPTABLE FOR CHILDREN TO LEARN FOREIGN LANGUAGE AT PRIMARY SCHOOL?,4.0,348.0,18.0,19.33333333333333,37.0,7.0,9.38888888888889,201.0,0.2816091954022988,0.146551724137931,0.1206896551724138,0.0402298850574712,0.0229885057471264,13.0,0.0714285714285714,5.778,0.5038961038961038,343.0,135.30344922737055,4.0,-0.2578466545878572,135.0456025727827,12.0,15.0,15.03,4.12434562090036,0.074,0.067,0.859,36.0,1.0,0.4389610389610389,0,0,1,0.0
"Sports involving a high degree of risk are one of the attractive physical activities which have been appealing to many fans. Many people claimed that authorities should not allow people to take part in these games, while others disagree with this idea. However, I believe that these activities should not be banned

On the one hand, governments have to ban dangerous games since these ones have a potential risk which players cannot control well. These games require people to have professional skills such as diving, jumping, so forth and practice them in many times. If people cannot meet these requirements, dangerous actions negatively affects on them. Take freediving as an example, to play this game, a gamer should be a diving expert, not an amateur and he needs to know his health condition to be sure the water's pressure not to cause his heart to stop beating. Therefore, to prevent individuals from the death caused by these sports games, authorities require people not to participate in them.

On the other hand, I argue in favour of the view that harmful sports are only a professional players' choice. People who take part in these actions are experts, they will do things others are afraid of such as jumping from a helicopter or a high mountain. Before doing activities in the outside environment, experts have practiced in harmless places, thus they can manage their actions and conditions. Moreover, they can discover many new places and make various pictures of these views. As a result, we can know more parts of the world where we will never go to.

In my opinion, politicians just need to alert people to be careful when playing these games. Comparing with driving carelessly on the streets, they are not as a serious problem as causing people's injuries to be limited

To conclude, there is a beneficial effect on prohibiting harmful sports. However, I strongly contend that playing these games is an individual's choice which the government cannot restrict",Discuss the view and give the opinion of dangerous sports,5.0,331.0,15.0,22.066666666666663,41.0,12.0,12.8,197.0,0.256797583081571,0.175226586102719,0.0876132930513595,0.0453172205438066,0.0332326283987915,7.0,0.0482758620689655,6.312,0.5040214477211796,330.0,145.89775351594005,2.0,-0.1286813955315309,145.76907212040857,10.7,13.0,10.85,4.132410875349649,0.122,0.104,0.775,41.0,3.0,0.514745308310992,0,0,1,0.0
"In the era of development, sports are multiform and considered indispensable with enormous benefits to humans. Some people hold the opinion that playing sports in teams brings many advantages to humans' life, while others believe that individual sports are more beneficial than team sports in different aspects. Both views are discussed and my perspective will be proposed later.

For people who approve team sports, it is advantageous in many ways when taking part in sports with teammates. Regularly, players in this kind of sports, like football, are formed in specific roles and trained with different professions; however, in a match, all of them have to collapse and each person needs to express their capability with the common aim of achieving a gold medal. Therefore, establishing a team which includes many players can help them to practice their how to cooperate and control their feelings in order not to put personality above common targets.

In contrast, some people stand in the opposite view that individual sports create more favourable conditions for athletes than letting them play in teams due to the effectiveness of individual coaching. People believe that coaching one by one makes the training process not to be interrupted by many factors, for example, the lateness of teammates. Instead of waiting partners which lead to delay the process, practicing alone helps athletes to save time and focus on the training.

In my opinion, each sport type brings different advantages and both of them are important to humans. Every sport has its own nature, therefore, because of that dissimilarity, people can not put them on the scale of benefit and discuss whether team sports or individual sports are more valuable.

In conclusion, the value of two sport kinds is still controversial when team-sport advocates think that playing sports in teams can be a proper method to connect people while others support sports which are played alone due to the efficiency in practicing. I am in the middle of the scale and believe that each of them has their own role in helping humans.",Team sports or individual sports. Which is more beneficial?

"People have differing views with regard to the question of whether or not zoos need to be maintained. While some say that zoos are merciless and should be closed, I personally believe that they would keep animals safe from extinction. This essay will discuss the two viewpoints.

On the one hand, there are two main reasons why zoos are considered immoral places and should be banned. Firstly, zoos are often aimed to entertain people and earn money from them, which means that zoos held animals not because of conserve, but because of making profits. Secondly, from a moral perspective, many zoos limit the freedom of their animal by providing poor-quality environments and facilities. Research has shown that the house of animals in zoos is far smaller than that of them in nature. This prevents animals from doing daily activities the same way as they do in the wild, which is likely to make them feel depressed and develop mental illnesses.

On the other hand, I would argue that zoos play an integral part in preventing animals from extinction. The fact that excessive hunting and poaching have led to numerous animals' disappearance, which is because their body parts are seen as luxury items and status symbols. Take rhinos as an example, they are killed or held in captivity because their horns are highly valued on the black market, pushing this species to the brink of extinction. As a result, Zoos act as shelters to protect them from poachers and these immoral behaviors.

In conclusion, although some people believe that zoos must be prohibited, I am of the opinion that Zoos can help protect wild animals from extinction.",zoos are cruel or can be useful.

"A number of people choose a company and they stay with this organization for the rest of their working life while others feel that there is more interesting when they change their working environment. Although both views have its benefits and drawbacks, I believe that employees should work for several companies.

On the one hand, there are several benefits for people who only work in a company. Firstly, they have a thorough understanding of their job, and it is also easy for them to connect to other staffs in working processes. For example, forming a group for new project is quite easy and effective because people have worked together before. Secondly, a stable job is quite safe because its pension and health insurance when employees retire. One more thing, employers value long-term workers for their loyalty, so that employees might be nominated for higher position as well a better reward.

On the other hand, people who stay with the same organization can get stuck doing same job year by year, and it may lead to boredom and disillusionment. Changing from one company to another may be a strategic decision, but with a deliberate plan, employees can have and acquire a range of skills and experience. For example, employees can learn managing skill when they work for an international organization in comparison with run-state company. They can also get higher incomes and bright prospects because their contribution in a larger scale. Another point, they can develop their flexible ability to adapt effectively to constant changing of the economic system.

"Various views are held on the issue of what type of factor is critical to triumphs in sport events. While some people may point out that athletes who are mentally tough will be champions, critics contend that lusty competitors are more likely to achieve stunning victories than the rest. Nevertheless, I am convinced that contestants having mental stamina can overcome stumbling blocks in competitive games. In this essay, both perspectives are under discussion as following.

Apparently, having a strong constitution plays a vital role in the athletes' career advancement. They are required to attend training courses regularly in order to be in good physical condition. As a result, players are capable of competing against rivals who are at the same level as them. It is therefore agreed that contestants' well-being is the first priority. If they don't have enough energy, they will definitely feel exhausted during the games and end up as losers. Cristiano Ronaldo is a typical example. Thanks to his strict workout plan, he is at the peak of fitness and in magnificent shape. At the age of 35, he is regarded as the most skillful football player due to impressive records as well as his lustiness.

Voices from the other side could also be heard against this matter claiming that athletes' mental power contributes enormously to the final outcome. Without demand management ability, consistency, motivation, focus, strong self-belief and control under pressure, players could hardly outperform their challengers. Besides, I firmly believe that the cultivation process of mental energy benefits them from overcoming their weakness and gaining a victory over themselves. To illustrate, during Roger Federer's first period of playing tennis, he unfortunately suffered the loss of success in the first round of Wimbledon. After consecutive years of accumulating experience, he has amazingly won eight Wimbledon men's single titles and gained several prizes. It is obvious that his absolute determination has made him one of the most inspiring tennis players of all time.

In a nutshell, some people are of the opinion that powerful contestants are unbeatable easily, whilst others are against such a view and credit the significant influence of a positive mindset. Personally, I support the latter stance since players with strong passion will doubtlessly seize the initiative in the crucial matches and tournaments and win the games.",Is the mental strength important for success in sports or is it important to have strong and fit people in sports.

"It would be argued by some that it is better for males and females to be educated in single-gender schools. In my opinion, however, it would be more beneficial for them to enter integrated education.

On the one hand, there is an explicit reason why some people believe it is useful for students to attend separate schools. The primary cause of this notion is for fear of study distraction. Specifically, there is little chance of having early relationships with opposite-sex friends if students solely enter single-sex education. As a result, they would seriously concentrate on their studies, leading to higher academic results.

On the other hand, I would argue that boys and girls should be sent to mixed-sex schools for several clear reasons. Firstly, one of the major causes is that students from two genders have the opportunity to comprehensively develop a wide range of solf skills. To be more specific, when pupils interact and engage in group work activities, they would be honed communication, teamwork, and critical thinking skills because each gender has possessed different perspectives and potentials. Another reason is that attending mixed schools ensures co-existence and gender equality. Evidently, students will get the equal scholastic system and opportunities to enhance academic knowledge and essential skills. As a consequence, they would find it easier to get a job in a mixed-sex working environment after graduation.

In conclusion, although some people think that students should enter separate schools, I personally believe that participating in co-education schools brings more benefits for them.","Some people think that it is better to educate boys and girls in separate schools.

"Experts believe that junk food consumption highly is bad for our body. Few people argue that education can be one of solutions to avoid them of it, whereas other think contrarily, it is not important to reduce the number of junk food consumer. This essay will discuss both points of view.

With regard to education in harmful junk food, people are provided to know how the food cannot be processed as fast as other food, it leads to people protecting their selves to eat too much junk food. Furthermore, it is believed by some that junk food is produced with chemical foodstuffs, which is danger for their body. Substances carcinogen in pizza junk food for example, it gives rise to cancer for them who eat the food. As a result, knowledge about it can fight them off eating junk food.

However, I do not believe these arguments stand up to scrutiny, the first reason is that junk food is easy to obtain in our environment, it has been enormous producing over the last decades. Secondly, it has provided really delicious taste, so few of them can make a stand their mouth to consume the food, even they do not have more time to prepare their healthy food at home. Finally, it has also been proven that education cannot effect people to eat junk food. Plenty of them really have knowledge about drawbacks of junk food, while they cannot avoid their habit to eat it. Therefore, aware of health is needed to be able keeping off to eat the food.

To sum up, although some people think that education is useful for avoiding junk food, I would argue that they cannot have healthy lifestyle if they are not really caring with their body.","Scientists say we eat too much junk food and that is harmful to our health.

"It would be argued by some that city authorities should spend more money to encourage people to use bicycles in the city. In my opinion, however, concentrating on building public transport systems is the better choice.

On one hand, there are a number of reasons why people believe that money should be invested more in bicycle use. The first reason is that cycling is a very environmentally friendly mode of transport. Unlike motor vehicles, a bicycle does not consume any fossil fuels so it cannot emit any carbon dioxide into the environment. As a result, it not only reduces air pollution but also makes the air fresher. Another reason is that people riding a bike can improve their health. In fact, when people cycle, the excessive calories in their bodies will be burned out. Therefore, they tend to be in good shape and get more energy for work or study.

On the other hand, I would argue that cities should spend bigger money on the public transport system. Firstly, the public transport system allows cities to lower traffic congestion. To be more specific, more people utilizing the system such as buses and subway means the individual vehicles will be reduced. As a result, people tend to be easier to commute and transport goods faster. Secondly, traveling by public transportation will save citizens money due to the large number of passengers sharing the transport. Therefore, it seems to be affordable for most people compared with other transport. For that reason, I strongly agree with the idea of promoting public transport.

"In recent years, when travel demand has become a major thing, the development of transportation is also raised as a big issue that people concern about. Some people argue that paying for building new high-speed railways is compulsory while others believe that it is better if that money will be spent on optimizing presenting transportation. This essay will look into both views and point my opinion.

To begin with, some people tend to be paying money to repair the old things instead of buying new ones since they do not want to spend much. This tendency is similar to the transportation field. However, the more fixing times, the more money people have to pay. As an alternative, if the problems occur in the major body of the machines, the money that people have to spend will be the same as buying the new ones which have higher technology and provide a complete function.

On the other hand, others think that spending money on constructing brand new train lines for high-speed vehicles is necessary to improve the moving between different places, leading to saving time. For instants, in Taiwan, while people have to spend 5 to 6 hours going from Taipei to Kaohsiung, they spend only 2 or 3 hours if they take the high-speed trains. Hence, it is needed to spend money to establish modern transportation.

Take everything into consideration, I believe that due to the possibility of wasting time and money on out-of-date vehicles, it is a better way to build new railways than keep paying to fix the old public transport.",Spending money on existing public transport or constructing new railway lines for very fast trains?,4.0,263.0,11.0,23.90909090909091,39.0,8.0,12.090909090909092,157.0,0.2433460076045627,0.1787072243346007,0.1102661596958174,0.0304182509505703,0.0114068441064638,7.0,0.0518518518518518,6.091,0.5397923875432526,258.0,114.72046930103065,6.0,-0.597794339350361,114.12267496168026,11.4,13.1,10.16,4.060355403607651,0.055,0.044,0.901,33.0,2.0,0.4602076124567474,0,0,1,0.0

Having a closer look at the table data, Tiktok-users continued to account for the majority in all 5 nations, while the American ""netizens"" virtually equaled the downloads of 3 apps. India witnessed the largest proportion of the social media's downloads (Tiktok, Facebook, and Instagram) in 2020, 99.8, 67.8 and 56.7 million respectively, while Russia's statistics illustrated the opposite status - seeing the fewest number of downloads in all the mentioned apps, with approximately a quarter as much as the figures of India's.

"In our lives, career play a critical part: it allows us to earn money and feed ourselves. In a number of cases, sticking to a job, according to a group of people, will help us to get a satisfying career life, rather than who usually change jobs. On the contrary, some people think in reverse that getting a new job periodically is much better. Both approaches have their pros and cons but I lean towards the second one. This essay will discuss both statements to prove for my decision.

There are several reasons why we should be loyal to our current careers. First, working on a job in a fixed office will enable us to get accustomed to a working pattern. This pattern will help to create a 'safe zone' for us, which will ensure the quality of the work. Moreover, a long-term relationship with a fixed environment will increase our reputation in the office itself. As a result, we might get some promotions for our jobs. Second, in contrast to sticking to a job, changing job frequently are likely get us down in a career path. Perhaps we will lose the chance of being promoted to a higher position when doing this.

On the other hand, getting a new job periodically will have some benefits too. Accompanying by a company for a long time might make many people, especially young generations, feel so exhausted. This sense of tiredness will undoubtedly demotivate them, leading to the low performance when working. Furthermore, by getting a new job monthly or yearly can bring us more creativity. Many new ideas will be created by the employees. Last but not least, changing job will, in some ways, help a company to refresh itself. This is so precious to its existence and development since it need to turn over a new leaf constantly to adapt to a fast-paced society.

In conclusion, it seems that making us into a new career frequently is better for us when comparing with the choice of working in just an office. But it still has some drawbacks. Therefore, we should be cautious when it comes to the decision.",Some people think that people who chose a job early and keep doing are more likely to get satisfying career life than those who frequently change jobs.

"While some people suggest that children of all ages should assist at home or at work, others believe that more freedom should be given to them after school. From my point of view, though it is necessary to enjoy life at all ages, children still need to take responsibility for family and society.

It is reasonable for students to do what they like outside of school. Nowadays, students spend most of their day studying at school and participating in extracurricular activities. This means they may have less time to enjoy their passions and explore new things in life. Furthermore, the curriculum in many schools is becoming so heavy that students have to invest more effort in completing homework, carrying out projects, and preparing for the upcoming class. Students, therefore, might be under great pressure to catch up with the learning pace of their peers as well as achieve high scores. For students to enjoy a happy childhood, besides learning, they should have opportunities to experience life in a more enjoyable way.

Nevertheless, being free can create some problems. Because students at a very young age have not developed completely in terms of physics and mentality, if they are able to do whatever they want, they may make poor decisions that could potentially harm themselves. For instance, many students are spending hours a day playing video games with violent scenes that may lead them to unhealthy thoughts and sedentary lifestyles. Parents should encourage them to help with housework because, in this way, children will use their spare time to take responsibility as family members. They need to know that doing household chores is part of their duties, and they will become more responsible and reliable once they get used to taking care of others. Moreover, by doing housework, children will be physically active. As a result, diseases such as obesity and shortsightedness can be prevented.

In conclusion, although freedom outside of school can provide students with chances to relax and enjoy themselves, it seems to me that children should be assigned extra work after class to show their responsibilities.",Should children take extra responsibilities after school?,4.0,348.0,16.0,21.75,36.0,7.0,12.0625,214.0,0.2586206896551724,0.1896551724137931,0.0833333333333333,0.0545977011494252,0.0459770114942528,7.0,0.0451612903225806,5.562,0.5322997416020672,342.0,152.97269697141016,2.0,-0.1133660433032865,152.85933092810689,10.6,13.6,11.78,4.483335601364813,0.179,0.047,0.775,53.0,1.0,0.4987080103359173,0,0,1,0.0
"In the art of management, admiring employees for their outstanding performances is an indispensable way to uphold the motivation and endeavor for working. One of the most common methods is to pay a better compensation which may reach some members' satisfaction, while causing demerits to the others. From my perspective, there are several measures to tribute the extra - ordinary staff which are required to be taken rationally depending on their demands. This essay will analyze the practice above comprehensively and introduce other popular styles of management.

Practically, there are various types of employees with different needs, which can be categorized specifically into five levels, according to Maslow hierarchy of needs. Those standing in the two first group concern mostly about basic human activities and physiological materials, including safety, employment to make ends meet, ...They are mainly manual laborers or employees with low salary, easily being content with bonus, as to better their living condition. In fact, the willingness to work diligently derives from the hope to ease daily spending burden and earn a financial surplus. It is inevitable that a majority of job - seekers, especially graduates, take higher consideration into well - paid jobs at first, in which stage, money is their affection in working.

On the other hand, in terms of professional employees, giving extra money is not a sensible way to reinvigorate them. Having reaped several benefits, including a high salary to fulfill their lowest human needs, they are on their ways to reach higher ones such as self - esteem and -actualization. As the matter of fact, recognition and respect from others act as a trigger for the hard working and substantial contribution. Based on this very theory, employers can introduce a reputation award, for instance, entitling the remarkable employee of the month, the year..., presenting their names on the honor board or as representatives of the company...Another means is to reward them with a further education and training in their specialization or soft skills.

In conclusion, a competent and considerate employer is deemed to know their employees' potential and internal demands thoroughly in order to apply the most suitable style of management that satisfies a large number of the company's members.",Rewarding outstanding employees by giving them extra money,4.0,367.0,13.0,28.23076923076923,52.0,15.0,13.615384615384617,237.0,0.2752043596730245,0.1335149863760218,0.1253405994550408,0.0190735694822888,0.0108991825613079,5.0,0.026595744680851,6.929,0.5555555555555556,356.0,139.17776668879438,3.0,-0.2163226824153682,138.96144400637905,13.3,15.5,13.64,4.812522840877239,0.213,0.025,0.762,47.0,7.0,0.427536231884058,0,0,1,0.0
"It is undeniable that the increase in the number of pupils taking extra classes except outside school hours is one of the most challenging issue in education. While some people deem that after-school lessons are vital for students' future, others assume that after-school hours should be utilized in leisure activities. In my opinion, I am in complete agreement with the latter statement.

On the one hand, taking extra learning classes is trivial and has a number of dire drawbacks to pupils . Children spend the bulk of their time at school learning to acquire comprehensive knowledge of subjects required for their examinations. If they continue studying for long periods of time, they will suffer intolerable stress because of information overload. For example, a recent study by Melbourne University showed that students who study more than 14 hours a day often contract severe illnesses relating to physical and metal ones.

On the other hand, that pupils utilize their after-school hours in enjoyable activities can have a host of profound merits. It is because when they socialize with their buddies, they would build social skills as well as learn to handle their emotions through relationships with their peers. Moreover, time spent outdoors and away from screens would be good for children as it refrain them from technology devices' negative effects. Numerous studies have consistently found that 75% of students spending a long time outsides don't face with increased vision problem.

In conclusion, children should be inspired to do more entertaining activities after-school time since they enable pupils to develop the full potential and the rise in taking extra private lessons should be reduced on account of its disadvantages to students' mental heath.",Opinion on extra classes; one of the most challenging issues in education,4.0,280.0,12.0,23.33333333333333,42.0,12.0,11.333333333333334,178.0,0.3071428571428571,0.1357142857142857,0.1071428571428571,0.0392857142857142,0.025,6.0,0.0405405405405405,6.917,0.5836065573770491,279.0,114.64156601477512,1.0,-0.0096964392170888,114.631869575558,12.4,15.3,13.35,4.359636788433118,0.126,0.094,0.78,42.0,2.0,0.4459016393442623,0,0,1,0.0
"It is sometimes argued that all students should be provided with free higher education. I completely disagree with this idea, because I believe that it does not tackle the root of the financial problem students face but could lead to undesirable outcomes.

In my opinion, only deregulating tuition fees would not solve any problems of the financial burden on young people. The argument in favour of free university is often that it should increase access to higher education for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. However, I believe this to be a very shortsighted view, as it usually does not cover other significant expenses that matter for them. For example, the idea of free education simply not address the rising cost of living including accommodation, food, transportation, and other necessities. Thus, poor families may still not afford to send their children to university, even if they are not charged any tuition fees.

At the same time, I would argue that a free higher education system could cause unnecessary difficulties. Firstly, such a system would cost governments billions of dollars, which often means they have to raise taxes to make up for that loss. However, it is clearly unfair to impose this burden on taxpayers as they do not profit much from the education of others. Secondly, I also doubt that job markets can absorb the overwhelming number of graduates in every field that a free-education system may supply. Currently, many countries are struggling to address the high unemployment rate of those with a university degree, and free universities will only aggravate the situation.

In conclusion, while free higher education might seem like a good idea, I believe that such a system would be unworkable and largely pointless.","UNIVERSITY EDUCATION SHOULD BE FREE TO EVERYONE, REGARDLESS OF INCOME.To what extent do you agree or disagree?",4.0,285.0,13.0,21.923076923076923,28.0,14.0,11.615384615384617,173.0,0.2350877192982456,0.1719298245614035,0.1087719298245614,0.0526315789473684,0.0456140350877193,7.0,0.0518518518518518,6.231,0.5394321766561514,280.0,123.18222119114648,2.0,-0.1443027110146016,123.03791848013186,11.8,13.8,12.01,4.335049086826929,0.14,0.189,0.671,32.0,1.0,0.4763406940063091,0,0,1,0.0
"Public figures are usually seen to voice their opinion with respect to public issues beyond the scope of their expertise. From my perspective, potential drawbacks of this tendency are incomparable to its upsides.

The fact that celebrities' viewpoints on a wide range of matters being publicized is indeed positive. Firstly, this could raise the public's awareness about the problem in question. Due to followers being predisposed to take what their idols concern into consideration, when well-known people share their ideas about a specific issue, it could instantly become the public's interest. Conversations featuring it might become prevalent, and numerous public members even do research, thus gain more insights of it. In addition, in some cases, consciousness of a matter brought up by famous individuals could translate into reforming initiatives in response. For instance, as an iconic figure raises her concern about the local environmental degradation, her admirers might be encouraged to organize campaigns for environment preservation, or simply think twice before littering in the park or discharging garbage into the river.

Nonetheless, a negative aspect of the mentioned development is that if public figures' viewpoints regarding issues outside their domain involve inaccurate information, several members of the community could be left ignorant. Idolatry could sometimes cause followers to take their idols' false beliefs for granted without attempting comprehensive research. For instance, if a celebrity, due to his superficial knowledge, consider an aboriginal group as culprits behind the extinction of a species, many of his fans might unthinkingly develop an aversion for the group, who are innocent people. However, this negative effect is unlikely to be severely damaging and long-lasting, since sooner or later there tends to be specialists stepping in to correct mistaken notions and leading blind followers into enlightenment.

To conclude, despite my recognition that celebrities voicing their views about a public matter beyond their profession is negative in some way, in general, it seems to me that this has more positive elements.",Film stars and celebrities often share their views on public matters that have little to do with their profession.

"In order to improve their education, children are participating in extra classes after school instead of spending time playing. This has raised a heated debate around the world whether it is a positive or negative development. Some people believe extra coaching classes lead to good job prospect, whereas others hold a distinctive view and think that children should spend their spare time on leisure activities. In my opinion, I believe that students should join extra classes if they are poor in particular subjects.

In fact, many students have difficulty to keep up with other students in their class, so going to extra classes is an ideal way to fill in the part of lessons they do not understand. In addition, as extra coaching classes generally specialize in a particular subject, the teaching method is much more better than at school and students are able to practice solving exercise problems from a variety of resource. Although self-study is also an effective way to improve their study, some students find it hard to practice this method because the lack of resource for practice problems solving and someone to explain to them.

Furthermore, in the extra coaching classes, students can also improve their social skill, which is very important in their lives and usually requires in almost every career. Even though spare time after school studies should be spent on playing or other leisure activities, children can also do these activities at the weekend and spend the weekdays studying hard. Besides, the break time between classes allows students to play games and do some leisure activities such as reading books or listening to music.

To sum up, participating in extra classes can help students in their study a great deal and they will get result after studying extra time. However, students should not overwork themselves and should spend the weekend on some leisure activities apart from study so as to refreshing their mind and relax.","Nowadays children are joining extra coaching classes apart from their school studies.

"Opinions are divided on whether it is necessary for new inhabitants to follow customs and traditions when they decide to live in a new place or not. Although the response to this practice could be justified, I completely agree with this view.

If customs and traditions in a new nation are not followed, immigrants will witness many troubles in their real life. Looking first at operating a business, entrepreneurs who live and start up in a new land will be successful whenever they follow the customs. Additionally, customs and traditions help their business distinguish the market sectors, which is an opportunity for them to keep customers and win with other competitors. The other problem is that people may incidentally take illegal actions. For example, spit gum in any public places in Singapore must be punished with a huge amount of money.

On the other hand, citizens have a wide range of beneficial effects if they get used to following local customs, related to respect and social isolation. With regard to the former, when people show respect for the local way, they will bond closer to the local citizens. This can lead to greater integration and mutual understanding. Secondly, newcomers can participate in community life so that they can avoid social isolation. There are a large number of events belonging to the new country such as festivals and holidays in which immigrants can attend.

"Humans are living in an era full of amenities and fulfilment as never before. Some people claim that constructing and assisting our lives is the grand mission of science. I agree that our society could hardly survive if we shut down science, but I think keeping sapiens alive will never be its salvage.

It is hard to deny that the application of science has created a significant change in our society's development, displayed by the existence of technology. For instance, the Internet and electronic devices play crucial roles in how people, regardless of living in the urban, countryside, or even between nations, share information and build businesses. Furthermore, there is no doubt that science has been a giant accomplishment of humans that differentiates us from other species. Indeed, the way we manipulate tools and develop such complicated levels of communication and scientific theory leads us to get excellent health conditions, dominate the planet and conquer beyond any man's wildest dream.

On the other hand, chasing that dream at all costs is not what we are ready for. As we hold every means of changing the world, man must take responsibility, and protect our home. As a matter of fact, humans have witnessed countless natural disasters resulting from scientific practice, such as industrial emissions and plastic litter. Nevertheless, since we are staying in a shared home, it is unforgettable to conserve the natural habitats surrounding us.

"It is true that we do not recycle enough household waste. Although I accept that governments should introduce laws to increase recycling, I do not agree that imposing laws is the only measure that governments should take.

In my view, It is essential to allocate money for environmental education programmes in schools. These programmes can encourage children to develop a wide variety of skills, but the main purpose is that they could learn to get used to recycling on a daily basis for protecting the environment. Furthermore, governments should run campaigns to encourage people to recycle waste, such as investing money in advertisements to clarify the ideas of 'Recycling' through a catchy slogan and an attractive design of signs, which are both memorable for different generations in order to influence their recycling behaviour better.

On the other hand, I believe that sufficient recycling infrastructure is the vital part of the recycling process. If recycling facilities are outdated or insufficient, it is unlikely to prompt people to recycle as much as possible. Some developing countries, for example, have a lack of recycling bins on the streets, which lead to low rates of recycling. Another motivation which may boost higher recycling rates is that governments tighten the law on recycling. People who throw certain amounts of waste into the rubbish can expect to be fined or to be asked to separate the recyclable materials and the litter for collection next time. If properly regulated, recycling can be done in a way that increases people's motivation for sorting waste.

However, people working for extended hours have been found having adverse effects on their health and personal life. In my opinion, a balance between personal and professional life should be created by restricting maximum number of working hours.

First of all, many of us would agree to the fact that people; who prefer working longer hours, do not find time to focus on their health. By working too long, they often become tired, lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick. Moreover, they become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons. The repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life.

Secondly, these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign. As they usually remain busy in their office so they do not find leisure time for such social activities. For instance, I would take my boss's example; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years. Recently, his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries. He started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him.

To conclude this, I would strongly emphasis and recommend, Government must include the clause of maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce to all companies for ensuring their employees do not spend extended hours in companies. This will help in uplift of society, and bring the lost equilibrium between personal and professional life of each individual person.",Working Extended hours should restricted.,4.0,361.0,17.0,21.23529411764705,40.0,9.0,11.0,207.0,0.2160664819944598,0.1662049861495844,0.113573407202216,0.0470914127423822,0.0193905817174515,8.0,0.0457142857142857,5.667,0.5163727959697733,355.0,154.81647165264457,3.0,-0.0723745352305515,154.744097117414,11.6,12.7,11.14,4.327866184965012,0.082,0.08,0.838,56.0,3.0,0.4710327455919395,4,2,2,0.0
"Even though it's more and more difficult to find a position in the workplace and the tuition fee in universities is increasing, I still disagree that we should abandon art subjects due to the following reason.

We all know the technology, such as computer, digital and communication devices change rapidly in the 20th century. We are unable to master only one skill like our parents or grandparents used to do and thinking we can rely on it for the whole life. Rather we have to think outside the box and coming out with new ideas that people need it but haven't invent it. By doing so, it requires the creativities to invent the new products that haven't exist and the ability to find out the people's need.

That's why arts subjects are so importance. For example, philosophy give us the sight of question the staffs around us and finding the nature of staffs, contributing us to think creativity, in addition, history tells us how it becomes progressive one step by step, which helps us thinking more logically and find out people's need. Still, art

For instance, it's no doubt that Steven Jobs is the genius of inventor in this century, if you have read his biography, you would find that he mentioned not only one times the important of art and philosophy effected his way of thinking, making him find out the element of staff and eventually came out of the surface that people easy to use with the perfect appearance. He also said that, sometimes you don't think the two things are relevant, however as you combine them together. It turns out to be a surprising result.

In conclusion, according to the reason I mentioned above, despite the fact that the practical degree is easily to find a job, I strongly stand on the side of supporting people need to learn art subjects in order to improving the creativities and logical thinking.

"In recent years, juvenile-related problems has become a major concern to many. So there exists the perception that a direct cause of the problem derived from mothers who choose full-time work instead of caring for their children. Personally, I feel that such a conclusion is nave and I will support my opinion in this essay.

First of all, children may have no chance of education when their mother give up work. The reason for this is that it is family financial pressures. In fact, expenditure of a family in modern life, especially for education, often require two salaries coming into a family to be afforded. Therefore, in the end, a mother to give up her job can lead to a negative impact on accesses to education of her child.

The second point to consider is that the root of the problem about youth is much deeper than caring for of a mother. What I mean by this is that if we are serious about fixing juvenile-related problems, we need to look at the underlying issues: poverty, unemployment, the violent films and so on. Focusing on these problems would be more effective.

On the other hand, I think we can agree that mothers should spent more time to paying attention for their children. They should have a part-time job instead of full-time job. Because they should always remember that they are working for a better life with their family, not living to work.

In conclusion, while it is common belief that working mothers caused the problem o the young, I believe we should consider the root of the problem rather than working mothers.","Working mothers cause the problems young people, agree or disagree?",5.0,272.0,14.0,19.428571428571427,31.0,8.0,11.357142857142858,162.0,0.2389705882352941,0.1654411764705882,0.0808823529411764,0.0625,0.0330882352941176,4.0,0.0338983050847457,5.867,0.5099337748344371,272.0,123.7409094866106,0.0,0.0,123.7409094866106,9.7,10.4,9.17,3.9207016362930274,0.078,0.13,0.792,32.0,3.0,0.5264900662251656,2,1,2,0.0
"Today, many people may hold the belief that all the young who are under 18 should devote themselves entirely to education rather than doing anything else. From my own perspectives, I would strongly agree with that view for some reasons.

To begin with, background education is truly fundamental and should always be respected by student's attention and effort. Some people commonly take highschool study for granted then don't usually learn very well. Consequently, when entering the labour market in reality, they lack the general understanding and as a result it is hard for them to create much value for their boss or even more seriously if they ruin the work they are likely to get dismissed sooner or later.

Secondly, people under 18 are also commonly too nave to stand on their on feet to earn for a living or support others. They are being on the way of becoming adults so there are still a wide range of things about lives they need to know about. It is understandable that they are probable to get into troubles and then don't know how to get out of these mess. For example, young people can easily be abused and exploited if they know little or nothing about the labour laws. They may have to suffer by themselves and this might lead to several consequences of young people being suffered from pressure or even mental symptoms.

However, combining with full-time study, young people should also concurrently participate in after-class activities like doing social charity to obtain more soft skills which are helpful to shape their personality. Applying for a part-time job can also be viewed as a good way to build up themselves as long as young people concentrate much on the experience instead of money aspect.

In conclusion, I am of the opinion that general education is of importance when concerning people who are under 18 and it should widely be favoured by governments and organizations from now.",Some people say that all young people should have full-time education until they are 18 years old.

"Some people argue that individuals cannot provide many influences in altering to the better environment, whilst big factories and businesses enable making an alteration. I strongly agree that such idea have the pivotal role due to intervention and capital.

The big factories have significant affection to intervene the advertisement. Maximizing this department causes the consumer be aware for care to save the earth. For instance, by doing campaign to the society throughout television or magazines that before shopping in the supermarket, they should bring the private bag from their own homes. As a result, the using of plastic bag might be diminished little by little.

Furthermore, the big factories have capital to control in producing less of pollution. A case in point, Toyota could manufacture the more electricity car rather than automobile which generally damage the sphere which has the potential adverse effect such as emission and pollution. Consequently, the deteriorate pollution could be combatted by controlling the production of car.

In conclusion, it is noticeable that the issue of environment is a complex one which is receiving more attention. To address this problem, It seems reasonable to suggest that individuals must grasp the nettle not only participating to utilize the items which contains less of pollution but also supporting the large companies to improve the environment and that is most obviously an impressive development.",Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment.

"According to British and Australian's policies, no source of details about the crimes the defendant had done in the past shoud be reached by the jury of a court in order to prevent the person accused from being judged in the wrong way. It has been suggested by some lawyers that this law should no longer be in use so that the jury can be more likely to reach a right conclusion. However, I totally diasgree with this suggestion, considering that the merits are not be able to fully eclipse the downsides.

One the one hand, this idea brings out the advantages to some extent. Access to past criminal record helps to lessen the possibility of incorrect judgement in the sense that it may assist the jury in figuring out the personality of the defendant. This might seem to be unrelevant to some people; however, in many cases in Vietnam, many juries make the second decision because of the person's profile. As a result, this may help us to avoid punishing the good and releasing the bad.

On the other hand, the opinion mentioned above is just theory; unfortunately, the shift in regulation tends to result in more disadvantages. At times, the past can influence the jury's emotion, hence make them easily judge things unproperly. That what people did in the past do not define them in the present is an invincible truth. Paradoxically, a clean record does not mean that a person cannot commit any crime at the moment. Following the same pattern, a complicated past does not say that a person certainly do harm to anyone at present.

In conclusion, it is my belief that the initial policies should not be altered. If not, the equality in court might not maintain anymore.",Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record.

"Health is an essential part of human life. So human need to good take care of their health rather than running towards hospital and medical store after sickness. It is agreed that the government should play a solid role against this critical issue. This essay will discuss the bad impact of treatments and medicine and it will elaborate how government can play a role in health issues.

Treatment of each disease is really much more costly now a days, and lower family can not afford such big amount fees for their treatment. However, they cannot even afford to buy medicine. In 1965, students of the California University of science research on human health of poor family and the problem they are facing in the treatment of disease. They conclude that 75% poor child died in the last viral effect as their parents don't have enough money for their sickness. It is better for them to better take care of their children's health, preserve them from all aspects which can become the cause of their illness.

The side effects of several medicines can also be easily found in the human. It can be possible from over dosage, may be because the prescription is not well suited you. In London times, the Health article reported that 57% females gain extra weight because of suing multivitamin tablets. It is better to use natural resources for vitamins and proteins, rather relying on medicine.

The government should announce good amount of money for the health department. They should control things from which people are becoming ill. For instance, pollution is the biggest problem, from which a lot of disease like lung disease produces in people of the country. They should take steps to control this.

"Television has been the most popular choice of many people to enjoy their leisure time. As a consequence, people have become more indolent and they are no longer socialising with others. I strongly agree with this opinion.

To begin with, concerning the matter of individuals are getting lazier because of watching television excessively, it is a fact that if years ago people used to use their free time with outdoor activities, nowadays being in front of the screen is the most convenient choice for the majority. For example, people have a busy lifestyle and are unable to take the time to go out for any kind of entertainment. In addition, the innumerable channels and programmes available are very attractive. Therefore, people tend to be home watching their favourites programmes. This behaviour gives rise to laziness which might also lead to health problems.

It must also be pointed out that television means being indoors most of the time and no social activity is involved. For instance, I remember that in my childhood I used to spend my free time doing sports or socialising with my friends. However, nowadays children are more and more addicted to television, which leads to them turning into introverts and losing social skills.

In conclusion, taking these factors into consideration, I am inclined to believe that television has made people physically inactive as well as limited their social skills. Although other factors such as the Internet contribute to this behaviour, the popularity of television is one of the main causes.",TELEVISION DOMINATES THE FREE-TIME OF TOO MANY PEOPLE.

"Assuring road safety proves to be of great necessity in elevating traffic security. The idea that only through rigorous penalty can traffic safety be advanced. In my opinion, there are more ways to solve such problem than just implementing harsh punishments on driving misdemeanors.

On the one hand, there are justified reasons from those who support heavy sentences in order to reform traffic wellbeing. First of all, the government dispel any ideas of the same repetitive outrages. Therefore, various kinds of penalties are imposed which contribute to enhance understanding for traffic attendants such as: increasing the amount of fine, driving license suspension, imprisonment,... Additionally, people are stimulated to obey the law willingly by enforcing severe punishments. For instance, when one gets punished heavily, he or she will instantlly be more careful by paying more attention while driving or slowing down in order to notice pedestrians crossing. Thus, new drivers especially the young who manage to learn before attending the troublous congestion is heightened their intellect by applying such tough sentences.

On the other hand, I would argue that there are some ideas served as solutions for decreasing danger on the road which is not only by imposing heavy penalties. Firstly, public transport should be reasonably decreased prices for everyone, mainly for students and senior citizens. Hopefully, traveling by public transports like buses or trains, which aim to be sufficient accords in both developed and developing nations, may be a contributor to diminish traffic jam and even air contamination. Besides, young new traffic attendants are encouraged to be educated before they are ready to meet the flow of vehicles. For example, ""joy riding"" is arised when someone steal cars and drive them without particular goals, but just the pleasure or trembling of doing so, owing to the widespread popularity among untaught individuals before driving. Hence, some people believe that everyone should be well-informed about traffic laws so as to minimize offences on the road.

"The income inequality among people has triggered several problems. The wealthy people can have high standards of living, while the poor is struggle to afford basic necessities. Some people suggest that government should provide assistance for underprivileged people such as the unemployed and the homeless. As far as concerned, I totally agree with this statement due to many benefits that these people can bring.

Firstly, these people play an integral part in the workforce. If the government takes care of disadvantaged people, they will become employees and make profits for both themselves and the national economy. Needless to say, these people are potential sources of blue-collar workers, so utilizing these sources is a remarkable way to improve the productivity of corporations. For instance, Amazon decided to rent 100,000 unemployed workers in the midst of the financial crisis, prompting mitigation of job losses. Apparently, disadvantaged people are vitally important to the economies.

Another advantage is that the stable lives of the poor are able to help the society remain robust. Several protests are held by the underprivileged people because their standards of living are adversely affected by the privileged people. Thus, providing the homeless and the unemployed with jobs to live by is the best way to maintain a ideal society. Relief bills, which usually signed amid crises , are a good example to demonstrate. They ease the tension of the disadvantaged people, helping the states to come through the crises. Thus, stabilizing every life is necessary for the development of the countries,

"Choosing a major is one of the most critical decisions in everyone's life. Many would prefer to pursue higher academic studies while some would be encouraged to join vocational training because of the current lack of skillful workers. From my perspective, ability and interest should be considered rather than the current job needs when parents decide whether to let their children continue academic studies or not.

Firstly, parents should help children decide their future base on their aptitudes. For example, if their children could solve math problems efficiently, they should be kindled their interests in economic-related jobs such as traders. So, pursuing higher academic study is an appropriate choice for them. Otherwise, skillful children could become workers so that they can make many systems as perfect as possible.

Besides ability, children's interests should be taken into account because of two reasons. First of all, if graduates can work with their interest job, they will have more energy and enthusiasm to develop their skill, their knowledge and the most important is that they can work with as least stress. Moreover, their career might be more stable than those working with jobs they dislike. In other words, they will find pleasure in what they do and tend to continue their employment so they could have more opportunities for promotions than others.

Some people said that if their children choose jobs that are suitable for them, but there are no vacancies in those jobs, they would become unemployed. So they encourage their children to train to become workers like electricians or plumbers, which works do not have enough qualified workers. However, if their children do not have any aptitude in finding electricity errors or they do not have strength enough to become a plumber, they can quickly lose jobs to those doing better.

"Recently, our environment has been in the limelight and have aroused wide concern for the negative impacts on human's survival associated with them. As a consequence, many people argue that living in a big city can result seriously on their health. Personally, I totally agree with this point of view.

We have nearly exhausted natural resource and left a big carbon footprint on a fragile planet. Undoubtedly, it may lead to a bad effect on our life, particularly in the city. Firstly, more and more company and industrial zones have been discharging chemical waste into the river, causing death to many fish and aquatic life, and without control, production processes may result in environmental degradation such as global warming stemming from factory emissions and the irresponsible disposal of industrial waste. Secondly, our activities are increasing the greenhouse effect, making the earth hotter and endangering not only mankind but also all life on the planet. For instance, the food we eat every day is almost covering by contaminated ingredients that have higher risk of developing several chronic illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes, some form of cancer and obesity

While there have been numerous international conferences to warn of the danger, many governments have refused to take an action. We are, therefore, can assist in the effort to alleviate the environmental problems in the local community through simple actions such as planting trees in the garden, recycling waste and enhancing awareness of people. Furthermore, we can reduce our carbon footprint by flying less and reduce food miles by buying local produce. People should also make aware of the need to cut down on emissions from their cars if we are to reduce air pollution. This way can help to bring us a fresh life.

In sum, no effort is too small when we are protecting the environment. Meanwhile, both local authorities and citizens must shoulder responsibilities in order to have a good health. Only by doing so, we can assure that we could hand this beautiful planet to our generation and the next generation after.",Living in big cities is bad for your health.

"Several people believe that Maths is regarded as an indispensable and pivotal factor in the success of entrepreneurs. In my perspective, I am in agreement with this, although it is not necessary to master the mathematical skills; however, at least basic ones

On the one hand, the proficient combination of a wide range of sophisticated skills from relevant areas of specialization is always highly appreciated once reminding the successful business practices. For instance, some prominent skills such as problem-solving skills, critical-thinking skills, expert knowledge, and establishing a long-term relationship with patrons or potential customers are a firm foundation to generate customer's credibility and faithfulness instead of just concentrating on formulating your business.

However, the prerequisite of an entrepreneur to embark on the business is the mathematical capability to anticipate the market trend in order to determine whether it is a strategic and lucrative decision to invest or not. Moreover, processing an accurately and promptly calculating competence brings about a competitive advantage in establishing the operating schemes as well as optimizing the profit and minimizing the expense, which contributes to sustainable prosperity. If there will be no ability to deal with the numbers, the owners would be more likely to encounter troubles regarding human resources. It is obvious that how to prevent the possibility of a number of persons taking advantage of their position as founding members to deceive and misappropriate capital and assets of other persons, especially persons lacking knowledge and experience is impossible with calculating skills.

In conclusion, nevertheless, it is evident that computing skills are served as one of the essential abilities, i also acknowledge that other social and logical-thinking skills are also equally important.","To succeed in a business, one needs to know maths.

"Regarding whether traditional buildings should replaced by the contemporary buildings brings the negative and positive influence is much concerned to a point where a wide discussion has been aroused. Some people hold that it is necessary that the modern buildings are instead of the old. And to large extent, I am on the opposite side of this claim.

First of all, not all the old houses are necessarily obsolete. In effect, some of them are the symbol of culture and history. The quadrangle dwellings, for example, have been going through the China History and it is such an awesome style that impresses the people around the world. Therefore, the government will not destroy them in order to protect our national art.

In addition to this, a proportion of people are adapted to the old living surroundings and it seems not too easy to change that. If all the traditional buildings drop down, some people will lose their home. For instance, many elder people live in their apartment during their whole life, and they never think about moving out. Apparently, some people only want to live the original place and the new things like the modern buildings do not attract them.

At last, the appearance of the modern buildings has never been equal to the inner value of the traditional buildings. Compared to the old buildings, the modern buildings do have the advantages, such as the function, the quality and the awareness in the environmental protection. Meanwhile, in terms of the macroscopic view, the construction of buildings reflects the flourish in the economy. However, if we live in a city with skyscrapers everywhere and cannot find a tiny culture around, it will be a pity for this city as the people live here are rejecting their civilization and losing the treasure which is the most important thing in the world.

Overall, destroying all the old buildings or replacing them with the modern buildings is not a wise choice.",Some people think old buildings should be destroyed and replaced with modern buildings.

"Some people believe that the protection of wildlife is unnecessary due to its waste of time and money. In this essay, however, I will change this school of thought.

Granted, one could argue that investing in wildlife conservation is a waste of money. This is anticipated on the assumption that such an investment would force countries, especially underdeveloped ones, to allocate substantial amounts of money to animal protection campaigns and programs, putting more burden on their financial situation. According to this theory, while these poor countries should prioritize their national budgets to invest more in education, the growth of economics, and healthcare, this matter should be addressed by powers such as the US, the UK, or the United Nations. In addition, the protection of wild animals, especially endangered species, often undergoes a multitude of experiments to find workable measures to save these species, but there is no way to ensure all these experiments succeed, irrespective of how hard scientists work, leading to a waste of time and money.

However, this line of reasoning is not sound because protecting animals is to save humankind. Take, for example, the many vaccinations that have been produced stemming from animals such as snakes, which play an important role in successfully treating thousands of people each year. Thus, the benefits that could be gained from animals are tremendous. In addition, by protecting wild animals, the world's ecosystem balance would be guaranteed. This means that if the extinction of any species occurs in habitats ranging from rainforests to the sea, there will be impacts on the survival of other species. For example, if all herbivore species disappeared radically, this would lead to the disappearance of carnivores such as tigers and lions due to their food chains being destroyed.

In conclusion, to protect the earth's ecosystem and the invaluable resources serving human beings, the protection of wild animals is necessary.",Protect wild animals,4.0,313.0,13.0,24.07692307692308,49.0,11.0,12.384615384615383,186.0,0.2907348242811501,0.1533546325878594,0.0798722044728434,0.0127795527156549,0.0287539936102236,6.0,0.0389610389610389,6.462,0.5139664804469274,310.0,121.3786165809209,1.0,-0.0786099520208539,121.30000662890004,12.7,15.9,13.29,4.457518545709108,0.119,0.07,0.812,36.0,0.0,0.4497206703910614,4,2,2,0.0
