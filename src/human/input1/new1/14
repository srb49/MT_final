DOWNLOADS OF SELECTED SOCIAL APPS IN 2020

The line graph demonstrates the number of 3 social media's international downloads over the year 2020 and the table shows data of how many downloads of these apps were in 5 selected countries in the same year.

Overall, Tiktok was the topmost over the period in terms of monthly global downloads, while Indian residents got the most access to Tiktok yearly.
Concerning the international monthly downloads in 2020, Tiktok was by far the most downloaded in January with 80 million downloads over the world, over twice as much as the figure of each other. Despite the figure's undergoing a significant fall and hitting its lowest point of over 40 million in September, Tiktok remained in the first rank in this respect, followed by an increase of around 25 million downloads in the final month. Meanwhile, the statistics of Instagram and Facebook experienced slight stability during the period, at less or more than 35 million.

Having a closer look at the table data, Tiktok-users continued to account for the majority in all 5 nations, while the American "netizens" virtually equaled the downloads of 3 apps. India witnessed the largest proportion of the social media's downloads (Tiktok, Facebook, and Instagram) in 2020, 99.8, 67.8 and 56.7 million respectively, while Russia's statistics illustrated the opposite status - seeing the fewest number of downloads in all the mentioned apps, with approximately a quarter as much as the figures of India's. In addition, in Brazil and Indonesia, the downloads stood at an average position, with no numbers over 35 million.
