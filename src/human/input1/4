There is growing evidence that man-made activities are making global temperatures higher. What might be the man-made causes of temperatures rising? How should we deal with this problem?

It is undoubtedly true that human - made actions are raising the global temperatures. This essay will look at several principal reasons and suggest some possible solutions to mitigate the problem.

There are some primary factors that contribute to the climate change. Firstly, deforestration is non-stop growing with little prevention from authorities, which mitigate the function of natual conditioning system - forest. Once this system is harmfully effected, there comes an unbalance in the air humans breathe. Secondly, factories and plants now are burning a huge amount of fossil fuel. Using these resources creates carbon dioxide and toxic heat into the asmostphere, resulting in a negative global transform .

Actions can be taken to solve the problem mentioned above. Most importantly, governments should restrict the number of tree cut down by imposing heavy pubnishments on those who break the rule. This could help nourish our forest so that it can fullfill its holly role. Another solution is that in stead of fossil fuel, people should use renewable sources to cut down the amount of exhaust in the air. Those sources could be wind, sunshine, water, etc.

In conclution, there are a number of factors leading to climate change and measures can be taken to tackle this issue.
