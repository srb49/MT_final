Air pollution
In the recent years, we have to face up to a serious problem: air pollution, which is predicted out of control in the future. It directly affects our lives. Air pollution occurs when the atmosphere contains gases, dust or fumes in harmful amount.

The pollution isn't natural, how it appeared? There are some causes. First, factories dump untreated heat, smog and sewage, waste into environment. Second, vehicles make exhaust and dust. Third, consumer and commercial products make landfills from its waste. Fourth, people burn trash and fossil fuel, it produces carbon dioxide. Finally, in agriculture, chemical substances (pesticide and herbicide), fire smoke and pollen can also be pollutants.

We are living in a big air tank. If the air is polluted, of course people are affected. Air pollution harm our respiratory systems, it leads to pneumonia, bronchitis, lung cancer or even the death. It changes the ecosystem, kills animals and botanical species. Air pollution contaminates water and soil, cause global warming and natural disaster.

We call for some solutions. Factories and transport must have exhaust treatment system. If people use electric public transport, cycle or walk, there'll be less poisonous fume. We ought to use environmentally-friendly products and renewable fuel, follow the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle) and put out all the fire. We shouldn't use fireplace or wood stove for heating and cooking. And the most important action is plant more trees - our nature lungs.

Protect the environment is our crucial responsibility. It needs our hands. If each one of us, the small parts prevent air pollution from happening together, there'll be huge effects.
